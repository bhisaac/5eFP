5eFP (fifth edition focus practice) is an open-source project uniting immersive, interactive tabletop roleplaying (TRPG) gameplay with self-reflection using the popular d20 fifth edition rules. Discover a new way to play TRPGs featuring easier, more intuitive rules, shorter game sessions, no GM preparation required, and larger player bases-allowing 8 to 50+ players.

### Playtest Material.

_The content and game mechanics detailed within the 5eFP SRD are presented as a playtest for feedback and development purposes. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in any d20 fifth edition campaign (5eFP also works with any game or game system), but not refined by final game development. These game mechanics are subject to change as needed, according to feedback provided by 5eFP contributors, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs)._

### This playtest needs your support.

Join our growing 5eFP community and start contributing. 5eFP needs ***patrons***, developers, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs).

- **Patrons** contribute weekly, monthly, or yearly financial support for the ongoing development and release of 5eFP content \[[more ...](https://liberapay.com/5eFP/)].
- **Developers** are interested in helping craft 5eFP game mechanics. They also assist by helping resolve rules conflicts with SRD 5.1.
- **Editors** wish to proofread 5eFP content and suggest revisions for clarity and ease of reading. 
- **Game Masters (GMs)** are interested in providing GM feedback regarding 5eFP game mechanics, pre-generated characters, and any sample setting materials. GMs are also interested in running 5eFP games.
- **Player Characters (PCs)** want to play a character and provide PC feedback within the 5eFP Enchanted Forest setting.

This project needs PCs with any of the following skills:

- **Rules lawyer.** 5eFP needs to work for everybody who picks it up and decides to give it a try. Therefore, the rules must make sense and must apply to all circumstances described in the 5eFP core rules and setting handbook.
- **Notetaking/short-hand skills.** One PC per party needs to be comfortable taking on the 5eFP session's notetaker role. New game elements or developments can arise randomly during gameplay. A basic and general record, including any plot developments or revelations discovered during gameplay, must be kept. Notes do not need to be elaborate. For example, an Enchanted Forest map tile might have something like the following notes:
>>> Tier 1: North East Highway: bandit cave (barrow) to the northeast, elaborate cave system extending beneath the surface, goblins, elite goblin mage (oddly civilized), elite goblin scoundrel (out of place weapon: crossbow), freed eladrin captives and goods (+1 eladrin enclave), treasure (healing potion), lit dungeon, private furnished study behind elaborate locked door, evidence of an overlord (boss) behind the goblins, false wall leads to larger complex.
- **Group leaders.** (players good at forming a party)

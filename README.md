### The Difference Between SRD 5.1 (CC BY 4.0) and 5eFP (CC BY-ND 4.0)

The System Reference Document 5.1 uses the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license while 5eFP uses the [CC BY-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode) license. Derivitaves or changes to the content contained within the SRD 5.1 document is permited; however, derivitives are not permited within the 5eFP document. 5eFP provides a standardized format and framework for all games matching a set of specific paramaters. Content creators are free to use, publish, and distribute 5eFP within custom and original worlds, characters, and content.

Wizards of the Coast, for example, could obtain a copy of the 5eFP document and publish a Forgotten Realms-based 5eFP game while retaining copyright over the custom, Forgotten Realms content. They cannot, however, claim copyright over the core 5eFP rules and system. If a creator publishes a 5eFP game using Forgotten Realms content without first obtaining permission from Wizards of the Coast LLC, the 5eFP game would be in copyright violation as indicated within the SRD 5.1 CC BY 4.0 license. Content creators must comply with both licenses in order to publish 5eFP games and content.

# 5eFP | About
5eFP (fifth edition focus practice) is an open-source project uniting immersive, interactive tabletop roleplaying (TRPG) gameplay with self-reflection using the popular d20 fifth edition rules. Discover a new way to play TRPGs featuring easier, more intuitive rules, shorter game sessions, no GM preparation required, and larger playerbases (8-50+). The entire playerbase does not meet and play all at once. Rather, players asynchronously form parties of 3 to 5 and collectively go on adventures to complete 5eFP game objectives together. For example, all 5eFP games have the same initial objective: explore and discover the world map. A 5eFP playerbase assembles into several adventuring parties over time to fulfill this objective.

### Playtest Material.

_The content and game mechanics detailed within the 5eFP system reference document (SRD) are presented as a playtest for feedback and development purposes. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in any d20 fifth edition campaign (5eFP also works with any game or game system), but not refined by final game development. These game mechanics are subject to change as needed, according to feedback provided by 5eFP contributors, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs)._

### This playtest needs your support.

Join our growing 5eFP community and start contributing. 5eFP needs ***sponsors***, developers, editors, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs).

- **Sponsors** contribute one-time, weekly, monthly, or yearly financial support for the ongoing development and release of 5eFP content.
- **Developers** are interested in helping craft 5eFP game mechanics. They assist in resolving rules conflicts with 5e SRD 5.1. Contributors also help revise and update the 5eFP SRD on GitHub.
- **Editors** wish to proofread 5eFP content and suggest revisions for clarity and ease of reading.
- **Game Masters (GMs)** are interested in providing GM feedback regarding 5eFP game mechanics, pre-generated characters, and any sample setting materials. GMs are also interested in running 5eFP games.
- **Player Characters (PCs)** want to play a character and provide regular PC feedback within the 5eFP Enchanted Forest setting.

This project needs openminded, reliable, and dedicated PCs, GMs, and contributors who appreciate and engender curiosity toward themselves, toward fellow players, and toward 5eFP's developing game mechanics. This project is looking for any of the following skills (in no particular order):

- **Emotional Intelligence.** The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
- **5eFP Apps.** Proficiency or familiarity with **Arrangr**, **Discord**, **Roll20**, and **Zoom**.
- **Legal experience with open-source projects.** Help ensure we are doing everything correctly for the health and wellness of the 5eFP project moving forward.
- **Open-source project experience.** Familiarity with open-source projects, github, and other related applications.
- **Group leads.** Players who are good at networking and scheduling adventures with fellow players and GMs.
- **Rules lawyer and/or 5e SRD 5.1 experience.** 5eFP needs to work for everybody who picks it up and decides to give it a try. Therefore, the rules must make sense and apply to all circumstances described in the 5eFP core rules and setting handbook. Rules lawyers use their discernment to help make the rules "low-crunch"/simple, intuitive, consistent, and accurate. Prior 5e SRD 5.1 experience preferred.
- **Notetaking/short-hand skills.** One PC per party must be comfortable taking on the 5eFP session's notetaker role. New game elements or developments can arise randomly during gameplay. A public record is kept, including any plot developments or revelations discovered during gameplay that have something to do with the overall story of the Enchanted Forest. Notes do not need to be elaborate. For example, an Enchanted Forest map tile might have something like the following as a note:

| \[Level 1] North East: Bandit Cave (Barrow)  |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| Cave system extends beneath the surface |
| Dark antechamber, lit dungeon |
| Goblins: minions, elite mage, elite scoundrel (crossbow), boss |
| Elven Enclave caravan (captives, goods): freed captives, returned goods |
| Reputation: +1 Elven Enclave |
| Treasure: healing potion, coin |
| Hidden, furnished study with floor switch behind locked mechanism/door |
| Evidence of a goblin boss: letters written in Common found at study desk--"spread chaos on the highway" |
| False wall in the north operated by a switch in hidden study leads to additional rooms |

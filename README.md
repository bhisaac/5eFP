# 5eFP | Fifth Edition Focus Practice
5eFP is an open-source project uniting immersive, interactive tabletop roleplaying (TRPG) gameplay with self-reflection using the popular d20 fifth edition rules. Discover a new way to play TRPGs featuring easier, more intuitive rules, shorter game sessions, no GM preparation required, and larger capacities—allowing 8 to 50+ players.

_This content is playtest material._

_The content and game mecanics detailed within 5eFP are presented as a playtest for feedback and development purposes. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in any d20 fifth edition campaign (5eFP also works with any game or game system) but not refined by final game development. These game mechanics are subject to change as needed according to feeback provided from 5eFP contributors, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs). The most recent edition of the 5eFP rules can be found at [https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/main/playtest.md](https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/main/playtest.md)_

### This playtest needs your support.

Join our growing 5eFP community and start contributing. 5eFP is in need of ***patrons***, developers, Game Masters (GMs), and Player Characters (PCs).

- **Patrons** contribue weekly, montly, or yearly financial support to the 5eFP founder, [Ben Isaac](https://liberapay.com/5eFP/), in order to support ongoing development and realese of 5eFP content \[[more ...](https://liberapay.com/5eFP/)].
- **Developers** are interested in helping craft 5eFP game mechanics. They also assist by helping resolve rules conflicts with SRD 5.1.
- **Editors** wish to proofread 5eFP content and offer edits and/or suggestions for clarity and ease of reading. 
- **Game Masters (GMs)** are interested in providing GM feeback regarding 5eFP game mechanics, pregenerated characters, and any sample setting materials. GMs are also interested in running thier own 5eFP games.
- **Player Characters (PCs)** want to play a character and provide PC feedback within the 5eFP Enchanted Forest setting.

This project needs PCs with any of the following skills:

- **Rules laywer.** 5eFP needs to work for everybody who picks it up and decides to give it a try. The rules must make sense and be observed faithfully as described in the 5eFP core rules and setting handbook. 
- **Notetaking/short-hand skills.** One PC per party needs to be comfortable with taking on the role of the 5eFP session's notetaker. New game elemnts or developments can arise randomly during gameplay. A basic and general record must be kept, including any plot developments or revelations discovered during gameplay. Notes do not need to be elaborate. An Enchanted Forest map tile might have something like the following notes: 
>>> Tier 1: North West Highway: bandit cave (barrow) to the north east, elaborate cave system extending benieth the surface, goblins, elite goblin mage (oddly civilized -- out of place), elite goblin scoundrel (out of place weapon: crossbow), freed eladrin captives and goods, treasure, lit dungeon, evidence of an overlord (boss) behind the goblins, false wall leads to larger complex).
- **Group leaders.** (players good at forming a party)

### The Difference Between SRD 5.1 CC-BY-4.0 and 5eFP CC BY-ND 4.0

The System Reference Document 5.1 uses a license that is more open than the license offered through 5eFP. Derivitaves--also known as adaptations and revisions of the core rules found in the SRD 5.1--is permited while adaptations and revisions to the 5eFP ruleset is not permitted. 5eFP provides a standardized format and framework for all games matching a set of specific paramaters. You are free to use and distribute 5eFP with your custom worlds, characters, and content that utilize the 5eFP system. Wizards of the Coast, for example, could aquire 5eFP and create a Forgotten Realms-based 5eFP game and retain copyrights over the custom, Forgotten Realms content. They cannot, however, claim copyright over the core 5eFP rules and system. If you create and publish a 5eFP game using Forgotten Realms content outside of the DM's Guild, you would be in copyright violation with respect to the SRD 5.1 CC-BY-4.0 license. Content creators must comply with both licenses in order to publish 5eFP games and content.

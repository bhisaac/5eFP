# Species
## Species Traits
The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one character’s ability score by +1. Every species also provides an additional improved ability score at character creation, provided a +1 or +2 is assigned to the designated ability score.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Playable Alignments
- **GOOD.** Favors the common good for all. Fairness and consideration of others.
- **LAWFUL.** Best able to turn chaos into a degree of order with purpose.
- **CHAOTIC.** Best able to grow and adapt to changes.
- **NEUTRAL.** Undecided. Understands that there are times and places for each alignment.

### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Your speed represents the maximum number of squares you can move during your turn.

### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Varities
Some species have one or more varities. Each variety has the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their variety. Relationships among varities differ significantly from species to species and world to world.

## Dwarf
### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by +1.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Stonecunning.** You roll all skill checks used to determine the origin of stonework with advantage.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Wisdom score during character creation, increase your Wisdom score by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Toughness**. You max wounds increases by +1.

### Highlander Dwarf
As a highlander dwarf, you are accustomed to rugged living at high altitudes and within mountain-dwellings.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Strength score during character creation, increase your Strength score by an additional +1.

**Bonus Feat.** You gain the *Moderately Armored* feat, ignoring any prerequisites.

## Elf
### Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by +1.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### High Elf
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other species.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Intelligence score during character creation, increase your Intelligence score by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

### Eladrin
Creatures with strong ties to nature and magic, eladrin live in the twilight lands of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep within a forest before fading back into the Feywild.

An eladrin's hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Intelligence score during character creation, increase your Intelligence score by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Fey Step.** You can cast the *misty step* spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

## Halfling
### Halfling Traits
Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by +1.

**Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

**Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Lightfoot
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Charisma score during character creation, increase your Charisma score by an additional +1.

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

## Human
### Human Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by +1.

**Adaptable.** Choose and gain one bonus feature:
- **Ability.** Choose an ability score unmodified by your ability score increase trait. The chosen ability score increases by +1.
- **Feat.** You gain one bonus feat

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

# Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your dwarf warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your halfling mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your elf scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with traits and important story cues about your character’s identity. Backgrounds describe all events leading up to joining a life of adventure. Your starting gear represents the implements and reagents typical of your chosen background. How did you learn the skills of your class? Refer to your setting handbook for potential answers to these questions.


The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).
In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).
If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

## Acolyte
You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 1 Coin.

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

### Suggested Characteristics
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

# 5eFP SRD \[playtest]

Welcome to the fifth edition focus practice (5eFP), a new tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) experience combining fun and immersive gameplay with deepening levels of self-exploration.

Inspired by the d20 fifth edition rules, 5eFP emerges as a completely new body of work whose core rules are system agnostic. Freely use these rules within any interactive storytelling game seeking 5eFP wisdom.

***Focus.*** Learning and gaining proficiency requires focus, time, and attention. Focus begins with cultivating greater awareness of thoughts, feelings, and instincts as sensations arise within the body. Reaching the next level of experience brings about greater awareness and deeper access to life's energy sourced from within ourselves.

***Practice.*** Focus alone isn't enough. Results require real doing through regular and consistent gameplay. We transform TRPGs into a mindful practice. Practices are activities we return to because they feed us in some way. Successful practices provide a kind of nutrient missing in other activities. Regularly playing 5eFP games from beginning to end, fully conscious and aware at least once per month, is our practice.

### THE FIVE SKILLS

The five skills are used in all TRPGs and interactive storytelling games. 5eFP skills grant deeper story access and greater player agency while encouraging their growth within the player characters (PCs) and our real life (RL). The five skills remind us of our abilities and our free agency.

### INSPIRATION

5eFP games use inspiration points. At the start of each game, the game master (GM) awards one inspiration point to PCs with one or fewer inspiration points. Each player (GM included) then chooses and dedicates two of the five skills by saying them out loud to one another.

PCs may spend inspiration at any time during the game to activate an inspired version of a 5eFP skill dedicated at the beginning of the game. PCs regain use of this feature at the beginning of their next turn.

Alternatively, PCs may save up to 2 inspiration points for later. Any unused inspiration points carry over to the next game.

Items, effects, or features within the game may provide exceptions to these rules.

### SKILL DESCRIPTIONS

***Insight.*** Your insight imbues inward sight, granting vision beneath surface impressions.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character can easily determine sincerity, true motives, and intentions within the current scene. Illusions, misdirections, disguises, or actions with the intent to deceive appear transparent to you. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Medicine.*** Your medicine stabilizes wounds.
>>> INSPIRED: Choose any number of targets your character can see within 30 feet who are unconscious or dying. Each target immediately stabilizes and wakes up with minimum health.

***Perception.*** Your perception enables you to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character receives all available pieces of information regarding the current scene. Hidden doors, creatures, traps, ambushes, whispered conversations. Anything arising from sense data or information gained through the five senses. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Performance.*** Your performance allows the satisfying completion of one action.
>>> INSPIRED: Whenever your character declares an action on their turn, you may use this feature to decide the outcome of the action and whether or not it was successful. You must choose to use your inspiration in this way before rolling any dice and before the game master declares the result of your action.

***Survival.*** Your survival awards expanded capacities, allowing you to identify and acquire new advantages, qualities, or skills.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character finds a path leading to another desired location on the current map. The revealed path is one of many potential pathways. This is the swiftest path. </br></br>
>>> Once per game session, you can use your inspired 5eFP Survival to activate the inspired version of a 5eFP skill you didn't dedicate at the beginning of the game.

# Species
## Species Traits
The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one character’s ability score by +1. Every species also provides an additional improved ability score at character creation, provided a +1 or +2 is assigned to the listed ability score.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Playable Alignments
- **GOOD.** Favors the common good for all. Fairness and consideration of others.
- **LAWFUL.** Best able to turn chaos into a degree of order with purpose.
- **CHAOTIC.** Best able to grow and adapt to changes.
- **NEUTRAL.** Undecided. Understands that there are times and places for each alignment.

### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Your speed represents the maximum number of squares you can move during your turn.

### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Varities
Some species have one or more varities. Each variety has the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their variety. Relationships among varities differ significantly from species to species and world to world.

## Dwarf
### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by +1.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Stonecunning.** You roll all skill checks used to determine the origin of stonework with advantage.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Wisdom score during character creation, increase your Wisdom score by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Toughness**. You max wounds increases by +1.

### Highlander Dwarf
As a highlander dwarf, you are accustomed to rugged living at high altitudes and within mountain-dwellings.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Strength score during character creation, increase your Strength score by an additional +1.

**Bonus Feat.** You gain the *Moderately Armored* feat, ignoring any prerequisites.

## Elf
### Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by +1.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### High Elf
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other species.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Intelligence score during character creation, increase your Intelligence score by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

### Eladrin
Creatures with strong ties to nature and magic, eladrin live in the twilight lands of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep within a forest before fading back into the Feywild.

An eladrin's hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Intelligence score during character creation, increase your Intelligence score by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Fey Step.** You can cast the *misty step* spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

## Halfling
### Halfling Traits
Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by +1.

**Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

**Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Lightfoot
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Charisma score during character creation, increase your Charisma score by an additional +1.

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

## Human
### Human Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by +1.

**Adaptable.** Choose and gain a species trait:
- **Able.** Choose an ability score unmodified by your ability score increase trait. The chosen ability score increases by +1. You also gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
- **Feat.** You gain one feat.

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

### Spell Slots
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you return to HQ.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.

### Spells Known
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

Whenever you unlock a Magic feature (i.e., Magic I, Magic II, Magic III, etc.), you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Ritual Casting
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

## Bardic Inspiration
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 10 squares of you who can hear you. That creature gains three Bardic Inspiration action dice.

For the remainder of the encounter, the creature can choose to roll all action dice and add the result to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration dice, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration dice are rolled, they are lost. A creature can have only three Bardic Inspiration dice at one time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA (minimum 1). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to WIS + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ. While away from HQ, you can prepare a new list of cleric spells by completing a short rest in prayer and meditation.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + WIS

### Ritual Casting

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

### Domain Spells
Each domain has a list of domain spells. You always have domain spells prepared and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare while at HQ.

If you gain a domain spell that isn't a cleric spell, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Life Domain
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

### Life Domain Spells
- bless
- cure wounds

Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to heal a creature's wounds, the creature heals one additional wound per spell level.

## Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

### Cantrips
You know two druid cantrips of your choice.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to WIS + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ. While away from HQ, you can prepare a new list of cleric spells by completing a short rest in prayer and meditation.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

Until	the end	of	your	next	turn,	you	know	the	location	of	any celestial,	fiend,	or	undead	within	60	feet	of	you	that is	not	behind	total	cover.	You	know	the	type	(celestial,	fiend,	or	undead)	of	any	being	whose	presence	you	sense,	but	not	its	identity	(the	vampire	Count	Strahd	von	Zarovich,	for	instance).

Alternatively,	you	can	expend	5	points	from your	pool	of	healing	to	cure	the	target	of	one	disease or	neutralize	one	poison	affecting	it.	You	can	cure multiple diseases	and	neutralize	multiple	poisons with	a	single	use	of	Lay	on	Hands,	expending	points	separately	for	each	one.

When you gain this feature, choose	two	of	your	skill	proficiencies,	or	one	of	your	skill	proficiencies	and	your	proficiency	with	thieves’	tools.	Increase your	bonus	by +1 for	the	chosen	proficiencies.

Whenever an upgrade increases either of the choosen proficiencies' bonus, increase the bonus by an additional +1. 

### Sneak Attack
You	know	how	to	strike	subtly	and	exploit	a	foe’s	distraction.	Once	per	turn,	you	can	deal	an	extra	+1 damage	to	one	creature	you	hit	with	an	attack	if	you	have advantage	on	the	attack	roll.	The	attack	must	use	a	finesse	or	a	ranged weapon.

You	don’t	need	advantage	on	the	attack	roll	if another	enemy	of	the	target	is	within	1 square	of	it,	that	enemy	isn’t	incapacitated,	and	you	don’t	have	disadvantage	on the	attack	roll.

### Thieves’ Cant
During	your	rogue	training	you	learned	thieves’	cant,	a	secret	mix	of	dialect,	jargon,	and	code	that	allows	you	to	hide	messages	in	seemingly	normal	conversation. Only	another	creature	that	knows thieves’	cant	understands	such	messages. It	takes four	times	longer	to	convey	such	a	message	than	it does	to	speak	the	same	idea plainly.

In	addition,	you	understand	a	set	of	secret	signs	and	symbols	used	to	convey	short,	simple	messages, such	as	whether	an	area	is	dangerous	or	the	territory	of a	thieves’	guild,	whether	loot	is	nearby,	or	whether	the	people	in	an	area	are	easy	marks	or will	provide	a	safe	house	for	thieves	on	the	run.

# Sorcerer
## Class Features
As	a	sorcerer,	you	gain	the	following	class	features.

### Proficiencies
**Armor:**	None

**Weapons:** Daggers,	darts,	slings,	quarterstaffs,	light	crossbows

**Tools:**	None

**Saving	Throws:** Constitution,	Charisma

**Skills:** Choose	one	from	Insight or	Performance

### Equipment
You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition	to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:

- (a)	a	light	crossbow	and	20	bolts	or	(b)	any	simple weapon
- (a)	a	component	pouch	or	(b)	an	arcane	focus
- (a)	a	dungeoneer’s	pack	or	(b)	an	explorer’s	pack
- Two	daggers

### Spellcasting
An	event	in	your	past,	or	in	the	life	of	a	parent	or	ancestor,	left	an	indelible	mark	on	you,	infusing	you	with	arcane	magic.	This	font	of	magic,	whatever	its	origin, fuels	your	spells.

### Cantrips
You	know	four	sorcerer cantrips of your choice.

### Spell Slots
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you return to HQ.

For	example,	if	you	know	the	1st-level	spell	burning	hands and	have	a	1st-level	and	a	2nd-level	spell	slot	available,	you	can	cast	burning	hands using	either	slot.

### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells,	since	the	power	of	your	magic	relies	on	your	ability	to	project	your	will	into	the	world. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Spellcasting Focus
You	can	use	an	arcane focus	as	a	spellcasting	focus for	your	sorcerer	spells.

### Sorcerous Origin
Choose	a	sorcerous	origin,	which	describes	the	source	of	your	innate	magical	power,	such	as	Draconic	Bloodline. Your	choice	grants	you	a feature.

### Sorcerous Origins
Different	sorcerers	claim	different	origins	for	their	innate	magic,	such	as	a	draconic	bloodline.

#### Draconic Bloodline
Your	innate	magic	comes	from	draconic	magic	that	was	mingled	with	your	blood	or	that	of	your	ancestors.	Most	often,	sorcerers	with	this	origin	trace	their	descent back	to	a	mighty	sorcerer	of ancient	times	who	made	a	bargain	with	a	dragon	or	who	might	even	have	claimed	a	dragon	parent.	Some	of	these	bloodlines	are	well established	in	the	world,	but	most	are	obscure.	Any	given	sorcerer	could	be	the	first	of	a	new	bloodline,	as	a	result	of	a	pact	or	some	other	exceptional	circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor
Choose	one	type	of dragon	as	your	ancestor.	The	damage	type	associated	with	each dragon	is	used	by	features	you	gain	later.

**Draconic	Ancestry**
| Dragon | Damage	Type |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

You	can	speak,	read,	and	write	Draconic.	Additionally,	whenever	you	make	a	Charisma	check	when	interacting	with	dragons,	add your level as a	bonus	if	it	applies	to	the	check.

#### Draconic Resilience
As	magic	flows	through	your	body, it	causes	physical	traits	of	your	dragon	ancestors	to	emerge.	Your	MAX wounds	increases	by	+1.

Additionally,	parts	of	your	skin	are	covered	by	a	thin	sheen	of	dragon-like	scales.	When	you	aren’t	wearing	armor,	your	AC	equals	13	+	DEX.

# Warlock
## Class Features
As	a	warlock,	you	gain	the	following	class	features.

### Health
**MAX Wounds:** 3 + CON

### Proficiencies
**Armor:**	Light	armor

**Weapons:**	Simple	weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving	Throws:** Wisdom,	Charisma

**Skills:** Choose	one skill from Insight or Performance

### Equipment
You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:
- (a)	a	light	crossbow and	20	bolts	or	(b)	any	simple weapon
- (a)	a	component	pouch	or	(b)	an	arcane	focus
- (a)	a	scholar’s	pack	or	(b)	a	dungeoneer’s	pack
- Leather	armor,	any	simple	weapon,	and	two daggers

### Otherworldly Patron
You	have	struck	a	bargain	with	an otherworldly	being	of	your	choice:	the	Archfey,	the	Fiend,	or	the	Great	Old	One,	each	of	which	is	detailed	at	the	end	of	the	class	description.	Your	choice	grants	you	features.

### Pact Magic
Your	arcane	research	and	the	magic	bestowed	on you	by	your	patron	have	given	you	facility	with spells.

### Cantrips
You	know	two	warlock cantrips	of	your	choice.

### Spell Slots
You begin the game with one 1st level spell slot. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short rest.

For	example,	if	you	know	the	1st-level	spell	burning	hands and	have	a	1st-level	and	a	2nd-level	spell	slot	available,	you	can	cast	burning	hands using	either	slot.

### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

# The 5eFP Framework
5eFP games follow the same rules framework.

## The World Map
Choose one of two approaches:
1. Gather and use a world map provided through a boxed game or
2. Create a custom map

### Custom World Map
- Map size: 14 squares by 14 squares
- 1 square equals 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters
- Players should be able to place a token the size of a poker chip within a world map tile without overlaping other chips or crossing over other world map tiles.
- Contains: (9) 2x2 world map tiles for each cardinal direction, (3) 2x2 world map tiles for each ordinal (hybrid) direciton, and (1) 2x2 HQ tile
- Draw clear boundaries around each world map tile (create a grid). Hybrid tiles: draw a dashed diagonal line from one corner of a the world map tile to its opposite corner in a color that will stand out. This dashed line represents the highway. World map tiles containing a highway are considered hybrid. While exploring hybrid tiles, players draw and play story cards from both adjacent story directions at the same time. Roads are hybrid world map tiles. They contain equal portions of both adjacent story directions.

Create your world map, making sure to leave one 2x2 world map square blank at the center of the map for the HQ tile.

Your map needs to be detailed and simplistic. Try to keep illustrations simple, consistent, and easily repeatable. Everyone should be able to see them and recognize what they are at a glance.

> >Running 5eFP with commonly available game tools:
> > >1. Use six sided dice as if they were action dice. Six sided dice are easy to buy at your local grocery store. Treat a die roll of 1 as one action (1 bolt) and a result of 6 as two actions (2 bolts). All other results are blank.
> > >2. Use four different poker decks with unique card back artwork for each story cardinal direction. At least two varieties of poker decks are easy to buy at your local grocery store. Create an encounter table describing 52 story card encounters for each cardinal direciton. Each result has a corresponding poker symbol and value. Jokers are shuffled into the decks. Jokers add a story card from the story deck located in the opposite cardinal direciton. For example, if you draw a story card from the NORTH deck and you draw a joker, you discard the joker and replace it with the top story card from the SOUTH deck.
> > >3. Use 52 small coins or life counters in a bowl (all one color) to represent the wound deck. When PCs recieve 1 or more points of damage that cannot be prevented, they draw that many wounds from the coin/counter bowl and place them in a visible spot within their play area. All players should be able to glance at a player's play area and know how many wounds they have at all times. When PCs recieve 1 or more points of healing, they may return 1 wound back to the bowl of small coins or life counters.
> > >4. Use a larger coin to represent 5eFP Coin. Put a pool of 15 larger coins into a bowl. When PCs gain a Coin, they draw a larger coin from the Coin bowl and place it in thier play area. Players should be able to see the number of Coin a player has at all times. When PCs spend 1 or more Coin, they return that many larger coins from their play area to the Coin bowl.
> > >5. Create your maps on measured and cut foamboard. Try to use scrap parts to create other game props such as the HQ tile or 2x2 obscuring world map tiles. Create (48) 2x2 obscuring world map tiles. You can paint these black or use a black marker, or use black foamboard.
> > >6. Use poker chips for PC and creature tokens. Collect five sets of different colored poker chips (look for a rainbow color scheme) containing 24 chips each. Buy a sticker book with 1.5 inch (about 3.8 centimeters) diameter colored dots with the same or similar rainbow color scheme. Affix the stickers of the chosen color onto the front and back side of your PC's poker chip. Gather the 24 pocker chips matching your PC's color. Reserve a number of colored poker chips equal your character's speed in your playing area. Set aside the remaining colored chips. Whenever your PC moves, you use these colored poker chips to trace your movement.

The world map begins obscured. After tracing the world map, place obscuring world map tiles over it. The nature of this obscurity is detailed in your setting handbook. The HQ tile is the only tile that is not obscured at the begining of the game. The HQ tile is placed at the map's center position. Obscuring world map tiles are removed whenever the PCs explore the world map tile it obscures. The following procedure must be completed in order to explore a world map tile:

1. **Preview.** Druids and rangers recieve a special bonus round. Each druid and ranger PC, in turn, may choose one unexplored world map tile within the current level of play and preview it's terrain by temporarily removing its obscuring world map tile. Once finished, the player then returns the obscuring world map tile back to its original position.
2. **Selection.** The PCs choose a cardinal or ordinal direction and trace a path from the HQ tile along the map until an obscured world map tile is encountered within the current level of play. This becomes the selected world map tile.
3. **Prepare.** Players may choose to spend 1 round of preparation before deploying. See "Preparation."
4. **Setup.** Place an empty (22 x 22) exploration map beside the world map. Roll a d20 twice. The first value represents the starting row. The second value represnets the starting column. Match the starting row and column to determine the starting position for the PCs.
5. **Deploy.** The GM adds the starting map tile onto the exploration map at the starting position determined in the previous step, placing the party token onto it.
6. **Chooose Party Token Controller.** PCs appoint one player as the party token controller. This player can be the party leader, but this is not required. The PC with the most overland movement bonuses is typically the party token controller. Some background, species, and class features provide significant bonuses while controlling the party token during the exploration phase.
7. **Move the party token.** The party token controller moves the token, lifting any obscuring tiles encountered along the way. Removing an obscuring tile may reveal one 5 potential world map features or footholds:
    - A dungeon
    - A creature (or creatures)
    - A village
    - A building
    - A treasure
    - A trap
    - A setting handbook specific feature or item necessary for completion.

# Exploration Map

# Encounter Map

# Headquarters (HQ)
Headquarters (HQ) represents the core organization(s) that all player characters (PCs) belong to within a 5eFP campaign setting. HQ can be an organization, a settlement, an outpost, a watch tower, a ship, or a station. All HQs have a dedicated society of supporters who help PCs complete HQ missions and guarantee safety and protection from whatever awaits beyond HQ's borders, provided PCs pay HQ's upkeep cost. See your setting handbook for more details on HQ upkeep costs.

HQ usually remains in one static location while PCs deploy on missions outward from the world map's center. However, some HQs relocate on the world map while other HQs have movable tokens representing a deployable vehicle or station with sufficient life support. Deployable HQ tokens function identically to static HQ world map tiles.

Sometimes HQs create satellite locations within the world map. Treat satellite locations as extensions of HQ. PCs can spend their downtime in HQ or within one of HQ's satellite locations, which may provide alternative benefits. Satellite locations are less secure than HQ, but remain relatively safe and protected, provided PCs meet HQ's upkeep costs. Local circumstances, conditions, and disturbances can affect the safety and protection offered by HQ. A temporary suspension of HQ protection results in PCs losing the ability to rest and repair. Coins spent on rest and repairs are lost during these circumstances.

## Game Session Start
You always begin the game at HQ.

You begin the game by revealing the HQ world map tile to all players. Place the HQ tile at the world map center tile position, reading any read-aloud text listed in your setting handbook for the start of the game.

## Game Session End
You always end the game at HQ. The following occurs when PCs return to HQ:
1. All ongoing encounter powers, abilities, and features end.
2. PCs may pay 1 Coin for rest and repairs.
3. PCs take one downtime round (worker placement) by placing their token on a building within HQ (or linked through HQ at a satellite location).
4. PCs gain the benefits of completing a long rest.

# Beyond 1st Level

As characters explore the world map and go on adventures, they encounter challenges granting experience, represented by Coins. See "Coins."

Characters advance whenever all world map tiles contained in the level 1 area are explored. Level 1 map tiles are adjacent to the QH map tile. This advancement is called gaining a level. 
   
When characters advance to the next level, their MAX wounds increases by +1. You also gain access to the next level’s species, background, and class upgrades. You may purchase upgrades if you have enough Coin to do so. Once a Coin is spent, it is lost. Some upgrades allow you to increase an ability score by +1. You can't increase an ability score above +5 using this method. ~~In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases by +1.~~

---
# Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your dwarf warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your halfling mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your elf scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with traits and important story cues about your character’s identity. Backgrounds describe all events leading up to joining a life of adventure. Your starting gear represents the implements and reagents typical of your chosen background. How did you learn the skills of your class? Refer to your setting handbook for potential answers to these questions.

The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).
In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).
If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

## Acolyte
You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 1 Coin.

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

### Suggested Characteristics
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

# Making An Attack
## Two-Weapon Fighting (needs playtesting)
~~When	you	take	the	Attack	action	and	attack	with	a	light	melee	weapon	that	you’re	holding	in	one	hand,	you	can	use	a	bonus	action	to	attack	with	a	different light melee	weapon	that	you’re	holding	in	the	other	hand.	You	don’t	add	your	ability	modifier	to	the	damage	of	the	bonus	attack,	unless	that	modifier	is	negative.~~

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand.

If	either	weapon	has	the	thrown	property,	you	can	throw	the	weapon,	instead	of	making	a	melee	attack	with	it.

# Encounters
5eFP uses encounters to describe all the adversity PCs encounter while exploring a map. Traps, creatures, and challenging story situations are all considered encounters. An encounter's statistics are determined by the type of encounter, the number of PCs, and the level of play. This section details each type and provides templates for quick gameplay.

## Type
Encounter type describes what kind of encounter it is.
### Creature
Monsters are born and thrive in the wild places between settlements. Creature encounters often rely on combat and tactics, but they do not require combat to overcome. Creature encounters are defined as one of three templates:

- **Minion.** Place (number of PCs + 1) minions onto the playingfield.
- **Elite.** As **Minion**, add 2 elites onto the playingfield.
- **Boss.** As **Minion**, add 1 boss onto the playingfield adjacent to a minion.

### Dungeon
### Settlement
### Story
### Trap

**LEVEL.** Encounter statistics are determined by the current level of play (LEVEL).

**Damage.** If an encounter includes a creature, a trap, an environmental condition, or some feature that deals damage, then it deals no more than the listed value per round.

**Armor Class (AC).** This value represents how difficult it is to attack a creature, adversary, or obstacle within the encounter.

**Difficulty Class (DC).** Use this value as the target number needed for a PC action to succeed during the encounter.

**MAX Wounds.** The total number of wounds the encounter can sustain. Creatures are knocked unconscious and must start making death saves when they reach their MAX wounds. A minion always has a MAX wounds of 1. If you want to increase a minion’s MAX wounds, promote it to an elite or boss.

**Attack Bonus.** The modifier you add to all d20 attack rolls used during the encounter.

## Generic Encounter Stats
- **Damage:** LEVEL
- **AC:** 12 + LEVEL
- **DC:** 12 + LEVEL 

### Minion Stats
- **MAX Wounds:** 1
- **Attack Bonus:** 2 + LEVEL

Minions don't need to be limited to creatures. Minion story-elements also arise. These are parts of the story that persist until the PCs intervene in some way. Intervention is defined as a successful PC action that directly affects the story. Becuase it is a minion story element, it only needs 1 success to resolve.

### Elite Stats
- **MAX Wounds:** 2 + LEVEL
- **Attack Bonus:** 4 + LEVEL

Elites can represent persistant story-elements requiring a number of PC actions over time to resolve. Elite mage story-elements are intense situations which dissipate qucikly once addressed. They resolve after 2 successful PC actions change it in some way. Regular elite story elements need 3 successful PC actions to resolve.

### Boss Stats
- **MAX Wounds:** 4 + LEVEL
- **Attack Bonus:** 4 + LEVEL

A boss represents a harrowing situation as a story element, requiring coordinated efforts and usually several successful PC actions to overcome. A boss story-element requires 5 successful PC actions to resolve.

## Creating a Creature
Choose minion, elite, or boss and use the corresponding generic encounter stats to begin creating your creature.

...

### Creature Type
~~The creature's type can add attacks, resistances, immunities, and special qualities. Choose from the types provided below. A type's features are included in the descriptions.~~

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and
mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

# Monster Abilities
**Bolster X.** This creature gains **bolster X**, where *X* is a pool of points used to reduce incoming damage. As long as this creature has a bolster pool of 1 or more, it may assign 1 or more bolster points as a free action to reduce the damage by 1 for each point spent. Spent points are lost. Whenever this creature gains two or more bolster pools, it keeps the largest bolster pool and discards the rest.

# 5eFP SRD \[playtest]

Welcome to the fifth edition focus practice (5eFP), a new tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) experience combining fun and immersive gameplay with deepening levels of self-exploration.

Inspired by the d20 fifth edition rules, 5eFP emerges as a completely new body of work whose core rules are system agnostic. Freely use these rules within any interactive storytelling game seeking 5eFP wisdom.

***Focus.*** Learning and gaining proficiency requires focus, time, and attention. Focus begins with cultivating greater awareness of thoughts, feelings, and instincts as sensations arise within the body. Reaching the next level of experience brings about greater awareness and deeper access to life's energy sourced from within ourselves.

***Practice.*** Focus alone isn't enough. Results require real doing through regular and consistent gameplay. We transform TRPGs into a mindful practice. Practices are activities we return to because they feed us in some way. Successful practices provide a kind of nutrient missing in other activities. Regularly playing 5eFP games from beginning to end, fully conscious and aware at least once per month, is our practice.

### THE FIVE SKILLS

The five skills are used in all TRPGs and interactive storytelling games. 5eFP skills grant deeper story access and greater player agency while encouraging their growth within the player characters (PCs) and our real life (RL). The five skills remind us of our abilities and our free agency.

### INSPIRATION

5eFP games use inspiration points. At the start of each game, the game master (GM) awards one inspiration point to PCs with one or fewer inspiration points. Each player (GM included) then chooses and dedicates two of the five skills by saying them out loud to one another.

PCs may spend inspiration at any time during the game to activate an inspired version of a 5eFP skill dedicated at the beginning of the game. PCs regain use of this feature at the beginning of their next turn.

Alternatively, PCs may save up to 2 inspiration points for later. Any unused inspiration points carry over to the next game.

Items, effects, or features within the game may provide exceptions to these rules.

### SKILL DESCRIPTIONS

***Insight.*** Your insight imbues inward sight, granting vision beneath surface impressions.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character can easily determine sincerity, true motives, and intentions within the current scene. Illusions, misdirections, disguises, or actions with the intent to deceive appear transparent to you. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Medicine.*** Your medicine stabilizes wounds.
>>> INSPIRED: Choose any number of targets your character can see within 30 feet who are unconscious or dying. Each target immediately stabilizes and wakes up with minimum health.

***Perception.*** Your perception enables you to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character receives all available pieces of information regarding the current scene. Hidden doors, creatures, traps, ambushes, whispered conversations. Anything arising from sense data or information gained through the five senses. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Performance.*** Your performance allows the satisfying completion of one action.
>>> INSPIRED: Whenever your character declares an action on their turn, you may use this feature to decide the outcome of the action and whether or not it was successful. You must choose to use your inspiration in this way before rolling any dice and before the game master declares the result of your action.

***Survival.*** Your survival awards expanded capacities, allowing you to identify and acquire new advantages, qualities, or skills.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character finds a path leading to another desired location on the current map. The revealed path is one of many potential pathways. This is the swiftest path. </br></br>
>>> Once per game session, you can use your inspired 5eFP Survival to activate the inspired version of a 5eFP skill you didn't dedicate at the beginning of the game.

# Sample Setting Handbook
## Enchanted Forest
The Enchanted Forest's beloved Enchantress Queen (Queen) falls gravely ill as waves of weary and injured refugees enter through all four charmed gates of Castle Somnam (HQ), bringing harrowed tales of encroaching darkness. The Nightmare, a darkly magical reality overlaying the world and the realm known as the Plane of Shadow (Shadowfell), breached the Enchanted Forest's borders, spreading its long shadows across the land and transforming all it touched into strange and twisted reflections. The realm is no longer as it once was. Castle Somnam remains the only location unaffected by the Nightmare, thanks to the monarch's mystical protections imbued within the city castle's walls. An elite assembly of champions, known as the Queen's Heralds (Heralds), are charged with keeping the realm and its people healthy, thriving, and safe from harm.

You joined the Queen's Heralds and now, just before your graduation, you are called to participate in one important, final test: you must travel to the Crypt of the Continual Flame on foot deep into the Megalithic Highlands. You and your friends must make the journey alone unaided by your fellow students, peers, and instructors. You must make your way to the Crypt using a simple map. There, you will light your torch within the Hall of the Continual Flame and return it as proof of completion. Only then do you officially become a Herald.

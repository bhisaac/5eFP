The Enchanted Forest's beloved Enchantress Queen (Queen) falls gravely ill as waves of weary and injured refugees enter through all four charmed gates of Castle Somnam (HQ), bringing harrowed tales of encroaching darkness. The Nightmare, a darkly magical reality overlaying our world and the world known as the Plane of Shadow (Shadowfell), breached the Enchanted Forest's borders, spreading its long shadow across the land and transforming all it touched into strange and twisted reflections. The realm is no longer as it once was. Castle Somnam remains the only location unaffected by the Nightmare, thanks to the monarch's mystical protections imbued within the city castle's walls. The Queen's Heralds (Heralds)—an assembly of elite champions charged with keeping the realm and its people healthy, thriving, and safe from harm—must assemble and help restore balance to the land and its people by confronting the Nightmare.

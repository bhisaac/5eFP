# Introduction
## How to Play
### Character Creation
**Ability Scores**

Whenever you create a new character, assign ability scores using the standard array: (+2, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1)

Choose and place each score as desired. Two ability scores represent advanced ability and talent (+2), another two represent aptitude (+1), another ability score represents average ability (+0), and the last ability score is challenged by adversity and unfavorable circumstances (-1).

### Round Down
Certain features and effects in the game allow you to divide a number by half or more. Whenever you divide a number, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater (minimum 1).

# Species
## Species Traits
The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one character’s ability score by +1. Most species also grant another improved ability score that gains an additional +1 if you assign a +1 or +2 to the listed ability score during character creation.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Your speed represents the maximum number of squares you can move during your turn.

### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Varieties
Some species have one or more varieties. Each variety has the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their variety. Relationships among varieties differ significantly from species to species and world to world.

## Dwarf
### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution (CON) score increases by +1.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is no fewer than 5 squares.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Stonecunning.** You roll all skill checks used to determine the origin of stonework with advantage.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Wisdom score (WIS) during character creation, increase your WIS by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Toughness**. Your MAX wounds increase by +1.

### Highlander Dwarf
As a highlander dwarf, you are accustomed to rugged living at high altitudes and within mountain dwellings.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Strength score (STR) during character creation, increase your STR by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Armor Training.** You gain light and medium armor proficiency.

## Elf
### Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, a result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score (DEX) increases by +1.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You gain proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### High Elf
As a high elf, you have strong ties to nature and magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other species.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Intelligence score (INT) during character creation, increase your INT by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Magic Attunement.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- **Arcane.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. INT is your spellcasting ability for it. You can also speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
- **Feywild.** You can cast the *misty step* spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

### Wealden Elf
As a wealden elf, you have deep awareness and intuition, and your attunement to nature carries you quickly and stealthily through natural terrain. Wealden elves tend to be reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Wisdom score (WIS) during character creation, increase your WIS by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Expeditious.** Your base speed increases by +1 square whenever you move through at least one square of natural terrain (arctic,	coast,	desert,	forest, grassland,	mountain,	or	swamp).

**Naturemeld.** You have advantage on stealth Performance checks while moving through squares that include natural terrain (arctic,	coast,	desert,	forest, grassland,	mountain,	or	swamp).

## Halfling
### Halfling Traits
Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score (DEX) increases by +1.

**Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

**Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Lightfoot
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other species or take up a nomadic life.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Charisma score (CHA) during character creation, increase your CHA by an additional +1.

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

### Hardy
Hardy halflings are tougher than average, sharing similar characteristics with dwarves. Their tribes can be found in remote areas or near dwarven clans, though some do make their way to civilized lands.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or +2 to your Constitution score (CON) during character creation, increase your CON by an additional +1.

**Resilience.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- Your MAX wounds increases by +1.
- You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

## Human
### Human Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by +1.

**Adaptable.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- Choose an ability score unmodified by your ability score increase trait. The chosen ability score increases by +1.
- You gain one feat. You also gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

#### Cantrips

#### Spell Slots
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you return to HQ.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.

#### Spells Known
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

Whenever you unlock a Magic feature (i.e., Magic I, Magic II, Magic III, etc.), you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

#### Bardic Inspiration
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 10 squares of you who can hear you. That creature gains three Bardic Inspiration action dice.

For the remainder of the encounter, the creature can roll any Bardic Inspiration action dice and add the result to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration action dice but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration action dice are rolled, they are lost. If the creature has Bardic Inspiration action dice and gains more, it decides whether to keep the ones it has or gain the new ones.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA (minimum 1). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to WIS + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ. While away from HQ, you can prepare a new list of cleric spells by completing a short rest in prayer or meditation.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your WIS whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

#### Divine Domain
Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features.

#### Domain Spells
Each domain has a list of domain spells. You always have domain spells prepared and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare while at HQ or during a short rest.

If you gain a domain spell that isn't a cleric spell, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### Life Domain
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

#### Life Domain Spells
- bless
- cure wounds

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.

Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to heal a creature's wounds, the creature heals one additional wound per spell level.

#### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

#### Cantrips
You know two druid cantrips of your choice.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to WIS + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ. While away from HQ, you can prepare a new list of cleric spells by completing a short rest in prayer or meditation.

### Divine Sense
The	presence	of	strong	evil	registers	on	your	senses like	a	noxious	odor,	and	powerful	good	rings	like heavenly	music	in	your	ears.	As	an	action,	you	can open	your awareness	to	detect	such	forces.	Until	the end	of	your	next	turn,	you	know	the	location	of	any celestial,	fiend,	or	undead	within	12 squares	of	you	that is	not	behind	total	cover.	You	know	the	type	(celestial,	fiend,	or	undead)	of	any	being	whose	presence	you	sense,	but	not	its	identity	(the	vampire	Count	Strahd	von	Zarovich,	for	instance).	Within	the same	radius,	you	also	detect	the	presence	of	any	place	or	object	that	has	been	consecrated	or	desecrated,	as	with	the	hallow spell.

As	an	action,	you	can touch a wounded creature and	choose to expend 1 or more points from your healing pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Each point heals one of the creature's wounds.

Alternatively,	you	can	expend	5	points	from your	pool	of	healing	to	cure	the	target	of	one	disease or	neutralize	one	poison	affecting	it.	You	can	cure multiple diseases	and	neutralize	multiple	poisons with	a	single	use	of	Lay	on	Hands,	expending	points	separately	for	each	one.

This	feature	has	no	effect	on	undead	and constructs.

You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition	to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:

- (a)	scale	mail	or	(b)	leather	armor
- (a)	two	shortswords	or	(b)	two	simple	melee weapons
- (a)	a	dungeoneer’s	pack	or	(b)	an	explorer’s	pack

### Favored Enemy
You	have	significant experience	studying,	tracking,	hunting,	and	even	talking	to	a	certain	type	of	enemy. Choose	a	type	of	favored	enemy:	aberrations,	beasts, celestials,	constructs,	dragons,	elementals, fey,	fiends,	giants,	monstrosities,	oozes,	plants,	or undead.	Alternatively,	you	can	select	two species	of	humanoid	(such	as	gnolls	and	orcs)	as	favored enemies.

You	have	advantage	on	Survival	checks	to	track	your	favored	enemies,	as	well	as	on Insight	checks	to recall	information	about	them.

When	you	gain	this	feature,	you	also	learn	one language	of	your	choice	that	is	spoken	by	your favored	enemies,	if	they	speak	one	at all.

### Natural Explorer
You	are	particularly	familiar	with	one	type	of	natural environment	and	are	adept	at	traveling	and surviving	in	such	regions.	Choose	one	type	of	favored	terrain: arctic,	coast,	desert,	forest, grassland,	mountain,	or	swamp.	While in your favored terrain, proficient skill checks	related	to	your	favored	terrain gain expertise. (Expertise allows you to add your level to your bonus twice.)

While	traveling	in	your	favored	terrain,	you	gain	the	following	benefits:
- Difficult	terrain	doesn’t	slow	your	group’s	travel.
- Your	group	can’t	become	lost	except	by	magical means.
- Your	group always acts on the surprise round.
- Your group may	move	stealthily at	a	normal	pace.
- When	you	forage,	you	find	twice	as	much	food	as you	normally	would.
- While	tracking	other	creatures,	you	also	learn their	exact	number,	their	sizes,	and	how	long	ago they	passed	through	the	area.

# Rogue

As	a	rogue,	you	have	the following	class	features.

### Health
**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light	armor

**Weapons:** Simple	weapons,	hand	crossbows, longswords,	rapiers,	shortswords

**Tools:**	Thieves’	tools

**Abilities:** Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT)

**Skills:**	Choose	any two skills

### Equipment
You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition	to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:

- (a)	a	rapier	or	(b)	a	shortsword
- (a)	a	shortbow	and	quiver	of	20	arrows	or	(b)	a shortsword
- (a)	a	burglar’s	pack,	(b)	a	dungeoneer’s	pack,	or (c) an	explorer’s	pack
- (a)	Leather	armor,	two	daggers,	and	thieves’	tools

### Expertise
When you gain this feature, choose	two	of	your	skill	proficiencies,	or	one	of	your	skill	proficiencies	and	your	proficiency	with	thieves’	tools.	As long as the chosen proficiencies or tools do not already have expertise, you gain expertise in the chosen skills or tools. (Expertise allows you to add your level to your bonus twice.)

### Sneak Attack
You	know	how	to	strike	subtly	and	exploit	a	foe’s	distraction.	Once	per	turn,	you	can	deal	an	extra	+1 damage	to	one	creature	you	hit	with	an	attack	if	you	have advantage	on	the	attack	roll.	The	attack	must	use	a	finesse	or	a	ranged weapon.

You	don’t	need	advantage	on	the	attack	roll	if another	enemy	of	the	target	is	within	1 square	of	it,	that	enemy	isn’t	incapacitated,	and	you	don’t	have	disadvantage	on the	attack	roll.

### Thieves’ Cant
During	your	rogue	training	you	learned	thieves’	cant,	a	secret	mix	of	dialect,	jargon,	and	code	that	allows	you	to	hide	messages	in	seemingly	normal	conversation. Only	another	creature	that	knows thieves’	cant	understands	such	messages. It	takes four	times	longer	to	convey	such	a	message	than	it does	to	speak	the	same	idea plainly.

In	addition,	you	understand	a	set	of	secret	signs	and	symbols	used	to	convey	short,	simple	messages, such	as	whether	an	area	is	dangerous	or	the	territory	of a	thieves’	guild,	whether	loot	is	nearby,	or	whether	the	people	in	an	area	are	easy	marks	or will	provide	a	safe	house	for	thieves	on	the	run.

# Sorcerer
## Class Features
As	a	sorcerer,	you	gain	the	following	class	features.

### Health
**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies
**Armor:**	None

**Weapons:** Daggers,	darts,	slings,	quarterstaffs,	light	crossbows

**Tools:**	None

**Abilities:** CON, Charisma (CHA)

### Equipment
You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition	to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:

- (a)	a	light	crossbow	and	bolts	or	(b)	any	simple weapon
- (a)	a	component	pouch	or	(b)	an	arcane	focus
- (a)	a	dungeoneer’s	pack	or	(b)	an	explorer’s	pack
- Two	daggers

### Spellcasting
An	event	in	your	past,	or	in	the	life	of	a	parent	or	ancestor,	left	an	indelible	mark	on	you,	infusing	you	with	arcane	magic.	This	font	of	magic,	whatever	its	origin, fuels	your	spells.

### Cantrips
You	know	four	sorcerer cantrips of your choice.

### Spell Slots
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you return to HQ.

For	example,	if	you	know	the	1st-level	spell	burning	hands and	have	a	1st-level	and	a	2nd-level	spell	slot	available,	you	can	cast	burning	hands using	either	slot.

### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells,	since	the	power	of	your	magic	relies	on	your	ability	to	project	your	will	into	the	world. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Spellcasting Focus
You	can	use	an	arcane focus	as	a	spellcasting	focus for	your	sorcerer	spells.

### Sorcerous Origin
Choose	a	sorcerous	origin,	which	describes	the	source	of	your	innate	magical	power,	such	as	Draconic	Bloodline. Your	choice	grants	you	a feature.

### Sorcerous Origins
Different	sorcerers	claim	different	origins	for	their	innate	magic,	such	as	a	draconic	bloodline.

#### Draconic Bloodline
Your	innate	magic	comes	from	draconic	magic	that	was	mingled	with	your	blood	or	that	of	your	ancestors.	Most	often,	sorcerers	with	this	origin	trace	their	descent back	to	a	mighty	sorcerer	of ancient	times	who	made	a	bargain	with	a	dragon	or	who	might	even	have	claimed	a	dragon	parent.	Some	of	these	bloodlines	are	well established	in	the	world,	but	most	are	obscure.	Any	given	sorcerer	could	be	the	first	of	a	new	bloodline,	as	a	result	of	a	pact	or	some	other	exceptional	circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor
Choose	one	type	of dragon	as	your	ancestor.	The	damage	type	associated	with	each dragon	is	used	by	features	you	gain	later.

**Draconic	Ancestry**
| Dragon | Damage	Type |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

You	can	speak,	read,	and	write	Draconic.	Additionally,	whenever	you	make	a	Charisma	check	when	interacting	with	dragons,	add your level as a	bonus	if	it	applies	to	the	check.

#### Draconic Resilience
As	magic	flows	through	your	body, it	causes	physical	traits	of	your	dragon	ancestors	to	emerge.	Your	MAX wounds	increases	by	+1.

Additionally,	parts	of	your	skin	are	covered	by	a	thin	sheen	of	dragon-like	scales.	When	you	aren’t	wearing	armor,	your	AC	equals	13	+	DEX.

### Otherworldly Patron
You ~~have	struck	a	bargain	with~~ are in the service of an otherworldly	being	of	your	choice:	the	Fey, the Celestial,	or the	Primordial each	of	which	is	detailed	at	the	end	of	the	class	description.	Your	choice	grants	you	features.

### Pact Magic
Your	arcane	research	and	the	magic	bestowed	on you	by	your	patron	have	given	you	facility	with spells.

### Cantrips
You	know	two	warlock cantrips	of	your	choice.

### Spell Slots
You begin the game with one 1st level spell slot. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short rest.

For	example,	if	you	know	the	1st-level	spell	burning	hands and	have	a	1st-level	and	a	2nd-level	spell	slot	available,	you	can	cast	burning	hands using	either	slot.

### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells,	so you use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Spellcasting Focus
You	can	use	an	arcane focus	as	a	spellcasting	focus for	your	warlock	spells.

## Otherworldly Patrons
The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and abilities and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### The Primordial
You have made a pact with a powerful elemental from within the Primordial Chaos, the home plane of existence for all elementals. Your primordial patron is strictly neutral in outlook and temperament, swayed only by their attunement to a specific elemental quality. Earth tends to be steady, tenacious, and indomitable. Water tends to be flexible and aware. Fire tends to be activating, charged, and focused. Air tends to be expansive and mobile. Primordials rarely involve themselves in mortal affairs or circumstances unless the elemental balance is threatened somehow. Such beings desire the propagation of the elements and thier elemental outlook upon the prime material plane through you, their chosen vessel. Primordials powerful enough to forge a pact and thier preferred elemental outlook include Phoneix (fire), Leviathan (water), Zaratan (earth), and Elder Tempest (air).

## Expanded Spell List
The Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

**PRIMORDIAL EXPANDED SPELLS**
|||
|:-:|:-:|
|Spell Level|Spells|
|1st|Burning Hands, Thunderwave|
|2nd|Acid Arrow, Flaming Sphere|
|3rd|Fireball, Lightning Bolt|
|4th|Conjure Minor Elementals, Wall of Fire|
|5th|Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold|
|6th|Chain Lightning, Freezing Sphere|
|7th|Delayed Blast Fireball, Prismatic Spray|
|8th|Control Weather, Incendiary Cloud|
|9th|Gate, Prismatic Wall|

## Elemental Attunement
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to shift and adapt elemental energies within the spells you cast from the Primordial expanded spell list. Whenever you cast a spell from the Primordial expanded spell list that deals energy damage, you may choose to replace the energy type with the type preferred by your patron (Phoenix: fire, Laviathon: cold, Zaraton: acid, and Elder Tempest: lightning).

Spells affected by this feature lose any secondary effects. For example, a cold _fireball_ no longer ignites combustibles within the spell's area of effect. Similarly, an acid _thunderwave_ does not push creatures or unsecured objects and no longer generates a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

# Wizard
## Class Features
As	a	wizard,	you	gain	the	following	class	features.

### Health
**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies
**Armor:**	None

**Weapons:**	Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows

**Tools:** None

**Abilities:** Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS)

**Skills:** Choose	one skill from Insight or Medicine

### Equipment
You	start	with	the	following	equipment,	in	addition to	the	equipment	granted	by	your	background:
- (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
- A spellbook

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips
You know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### Spellbook
You have a spellbook containing six 1st-­level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your INT + the number of Magic upgrades you've unlocked (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a wizard who has upgraded Magic three times, you have four 1st-­level and two 2nd-­level spell slots. With an INT of +3, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-­level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-­level or a 2nd-­level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability
INT is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,	since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your INT whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your INT when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + INT

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + INT

### Spellcasting Focus
You	can	use	an	arcane focus	as	a	spellcasting	focus for	your	wizard	spells.

### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you complete a Spells upgrade, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than your wizard level, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 2nd-­level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-­level spell slot or two 1st-­level spell slots.

> ### Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
> 
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 1 coin. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and coin, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
> 
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared
into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
> 
> ***The Book’s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

# Beyond 1st Level
Players gain experience by discovering and resolving world map tiles. When all tiles in the current level of play are discovered and resolved, the next level of play on the world map unlocks and players advance to the next level. This is called gaining a level.

When your character gains a level, you can spend Coin to gain additional features available to your background, class, or species. These features are detailed in the background, class, and species descriptions below. Some of these features allow you to increase one ability score by +1. You can’t increase an ability score above +5.

Each time you gain a level, your MAX wounds increases by +1.

Whenever your CON changes, recalculate your MAX wounds with the new CON score.

## Alignment
A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Player characters must select a non-evil alignment at character creation. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

> ### Playable Alignments
>> **GOOD.** Favors the common good for all. Fairness and consideration of others.
>> 
>> **LAWFUL.** Best able to turn chaos into a degree of order with purpose.
>> 
>> **CHAOTIC.** Best able to grow and adapt to changes.
>> 
>> **NEUTRAL.** Undecided. Understands that there is a time and place for each alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid species can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-­aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other species, though, made those species to serve them. Those species have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-­orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

## Languages
Your species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.

**STANDARD LANGUAGES**

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the GM uses to reward you when you show up to play a game session on time and for playing your character in an exceptional way.

### Gaining Inspiration
At the beginning of each game session, PCs choose and dedicate two skills. Once the choices are made, the chosen dedications cannot be changed until the beginning of the next game session. Your GM then awards inspiration to all present PCs. Your GM also has the option to grant you inspiration for various reasons during gameplay. Generally, inspiration is given when you effectively portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM or setting handbook may introduce other ways to earn inspiration during the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. Alternatively, you may expend your inspiration anytime to activate an inspired version of a dedicated skill. You do not roll dice whenever you activate an inspired version of a dedicated skill. You automatically receive the listed benefits.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

### Inspired Skills
***INSIGHT.*** Your character can easily determine sincerity, true motives, and intentions within the current scene. Illusions, misdirections, disguises, or actions intending to deceive appear transparent to you. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***MEDICINE.*** Choose any number of targets your character can see within 30 feet of you who are unconscious or dying. Each target immediately stabilizes and wakes up with minimum health.

***PERCEPTION.*** Your character receives all available pieces of information regarding the current scene. Hidden doors, creatures, traps, ambushes, whispered conversations—anything arising from sense data or information gained through the five senses. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***PERFORMANCE.*** You decide the outcome of the next action your character declares on their turn. You must use your inspiration this way before taking an action or rolling any dice. If the result of your chosen action further affects you on subsequent rounds, roll all attacks, ability checks, and saves relating to the chosen action with advantage until the end of the encounter.

>> Example 1:
>>> (_GM_) "The room opens up, exposing a sprawling cliff face leading to the top of the spire."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "I spend my inspiration to activate inspired PERFORMANCE."
>>> 
>>> (_GM_) "OK, great. Tell us about what action you're character wants to take. And then, when you're ready, tell us what happens."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "Thanks. Lita leaps onto the cliff face, finds her grip, and makes her way to the top."
>>> 
>> In example 1, _Player 1_'s action resolves a successful Performance check without rolling to begin climbing the cliff face to reach the top of the spire, which is 40 squares above Lita's position. _Player 1_ has indicated that this climb is important in some way. While climbing the cliff, Lita then makes all attacks, ability checks, and saves with advantage. Later on, during the cliff-face encounter, Lita's skill is tested once again due to strong winds. She must succeed on a Performance check to keep her grip. Because she is still in the same cliff-face encounter, she rolls Performance with advantage.
>> 
>> Example 2: 
>>> _(GM)_ "Lita, it's your turn."
>>>

***SURVIVAL.*** Your character finds a path leading to another desired location on the current map. The revealed path must be traversable and cannot put PCs directly into harm's way. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no pathway is revealed. Alternatively, once per game session, you can use your inspired Survival to activate the inspired version of another skill you didn't dedicate at the beginning of the game.

# Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your dwarf warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your halfling mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your elf scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with traits and important story cues about your character’s identity. Backgrounds describe all events leading up to joining a life of adventure. Your starting gear represents the implements and reagents typical of your chosen background. How did you learn the skills of your class? Refer to your setting handbook for potential answers to these questions.

The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds presented here provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).
In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).
If your character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by species. See “Languages.”

### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment.

### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

## Acolyte
You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

#### Proficiencies
**Skills:** Insight

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 1 Coin.

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. Whenever you spend a downtime round at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, you gain Rest and Repairs for free. Additionally, the following downtime options open up for you and for your allies in the HQ temple. After finishing the downtime round, you may gain holy water.
- Spend herbs to get (1) healing potion.
- Spend 1 coin to cast *lesser restoration*.
- Spend 5 coins to cast *greater restoration*.
- Spend 25 coins to cast *raise dead* on a fallen ally.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

### Suggested Characteristics
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or oath taken to an extreme.

# Equipment
## Coins
A 5eFP game uses coins (**⛁** equals 1 coin), a single denomination representing wealth, resources, experience, and reputation. The name of a coin may change in some 5eFP games. For example, coins might be called "gold pieces" in a medieval fantasy setting, while coins might refer to "credits" in a futuristic sci-fi setting. A game's setting handbook details what coins are called in a game. All coins use the following rules.

## Earning Coins
GMs award **⛁** whenever PCs complete an encounter. Award +⛁ when the following conditions are met:

- The PCs find one or more treasures during the encounter.
- The PCs increase one or more reputations during the encounter.

The number of coins GMs award when encounters are completed increases to 2**⛁** starting at 3rd level and 3**⛁** beginning at 6th level.

### Spending Coins
PCs may spend coins during downtime (see Between Adventures) or during preparation (see Preparation) before deploying to a world map tile. PCs may spend any number of coins. Once a coin is spent, it is lost.

A game feature may temporarily grant PCs the ability to spend one or more coins. The feature explains when this happens and provides guidelines for how many coins a PC can choose to spend.

## Selling Treasure
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to HQ ~, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot~.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. This means you must sell two pieces of equipment in order to receive +1⛁.  Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond what simple coins represent and should always be treated as such. 

PCs may choose to create a magic item marketplace by unlocking this building through downtime research.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items are included in the description of coins. Coins do not differentiate between coins, gems, jewelry, and art for ease of use and simplicity.

**Trade Goods.** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

## Armor
Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into four categories: cloth, leather, chain, and plate. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any skill check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

...

|||
|:-|:-|
|No Armor|AC 10 + DEX|
|Light Armor|AC 11 + DEX|
|Medium Armor|AC 16 (STR +1 or greater)|
|Heavy Armor|AC 18 (STR +2 or greater)|
|Shield|+2 AC|

...

||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Light Armor**|**Modifiers**|**Cost**|
||||
|Padded|Disadvantage|⛁|
|Leather||⛁|
|Studded Leather|+1|2⛁|
||||
|**Medium Armor**|**Modifiers**|**Cost**|

|Half Plate|Max DEX +2, disadvantage|3⛁|
|Breastplate|Max DEX +2|4⛁|
||||
|**Heavy Armor**|**Modifiers**|**Cost**|
||||
|Chain Mail|Disadvantage|3⛁|
|Full Plate|Disadvantage|5⛁|

Armor listed with disadvantage imposes disadvantage to any Performance skill check used for quick, agile, and stealthy actions while the armor is equipped.

# The 5eFP Framework
All 5eFP games follow the same rules framework.

Elements of a 5eFP game:
- **Fast Travel.** Once a destination is set on the world map, the PCs instantly arrive at an unexplored map tile.
- **Recall.** Once deployed, PCs may recall back to headquarters anytime by performing a special 1-minute ritual. Alternatively, PCs all recall back to HQ after 8 hours have elapsed. A PC may only recall once daily.
- **Headquarters (HQ).** The game has a centralized organization linking each PC to one another. Players almost always begin and end a game session at HQ.

## The World Map
- Map size: 14 squares by 14 squares
- Scale: 1 square equals 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters
- Contains: (9) 2x2 world map tiles for each cardinal direction, (3) 2x2 world map tiles for each ordinal (hybrid) direction, and (1) 2x2 HQ tile

Draw clear boundaries around each world map tile (use a grid). Hybrid tiles: draw a dashed diagonal line from one corner of the world map tile to its opposite corner in a color that will stand out. This dashed line represents the road or highway. World map tiles containing a highway are considered hybrid. While exploring hybrid tiles, players simultaneously draw and play story cards from both adjacent story directions.

The world map begins obscured. After choosing or creating the world map, place obscuring world map tiles over it. The nature of this obscurity is detailed in your setting handbook. The HQ (headquarters) tile is the only one not obscured at the beginning of the game. The HQ tile is placed at the map's center position. Obscuring world map tiles are removed whenever the PCs explore the world map tile it obscures. The following procedure must be completed to explore a world map tile:

- Explore 55% or more of the map.
- Find and resolve 3 footholds.
- Locate an item or perform an action according to the setting handbook.

Steps taken for world map deployment.
1. **Preview.** Druids and rangers receive a special bonus round. Each druid and ranger PC, in initiative order, may choose one unexplored world map tile within the current level of play and preview its terrain by temporarily removing its obscuring world map tile. Once finished, the player then returns the obscuring world map tile back to its original position.
2. **Selection.** The PCs, as a group, choose a cardinal or ordinal direction and trace a path from the HQ tile along the map until an obscured world map tile is encountered within the current level of play. This becomes the selected world map tile.
3. **Prepare.** Players may choose to spend 1 round of preparation before deploying. See "Preparation."
4. **Setup.** Place an empty (22 x 22) exploration map beside the world map. Roll a d20 onto the exploration map before placing any tiles and note the location of where the dice lands. This determines the starting position for the PCs.
5. **Deploy.** The GM reveals the starting map tile on the exploration map at the starting position determined in the previous step, placing the party token onto it.
6. **Choose Party Token Controller.** PCs appoint one player as the party token controller. This player can be the party leader, but this is not required. The PC with the most overland movement bonuses is typically the party token controller. Some background, species, and class features provide significant bonuses while controlling the party token during the exploration phase.
7. **Move the party token.** The party token controller moves the token, lifting any obscuring tiles encountered along the way. Removing an obscuring tile may reveal one of several potential world map features called footholds:
    - Dungeons
    - Creatures
    - Villages or settlements
    - Buildings
    - Treasures
    - Traps
    - Specific features or items necessary for completion as outlined in your setting handbook.

# Exploration Map

# Encounter Map

# Headquarters (HQ)
Headquarters (HQ) represents the core organization(s) that all player characters (PCs) belong to within a 5eFP campaign setting. HQ can be an organization, a settlement, an outpost, a watch tower, a ship, or a station. All HQs have a dedicated society of supporters who help PCs complete HQ missions and guarantee safety and protection from whatever awaits beyond HQ's borders, provided PCs pay HQ's upkeep cost. See your setting handbook for more details on HQ upkeep costs.

HQ usually remains in one static location while PCs deploy on missions outward from the world map's center. However, some HQs relocate on the world map while other HQs have movable tokens representing a deployable vehicle or station with sufficient life support. Deployable HQ tokens function identically to static HQ world map tiles.

Sometimes HQs create satellite locations within the world map. Treat satellite locations as extensions of HQ. PCs can spend their downtime in HQ or within one of HQ's satellite locations, which may provide alternative benefits. Satellite locations are less secure than HQ, but remain relatively safe and protected, provided PCs meet HQ's upkeep costs. Local circumstances, conditions, and disturbances can affect the safety and protection offered by HQ. A temporary suspension of HQ protection results in PCs losing the ability to rest and repair. Coins spent on rest and repairs are lost during these circumstances.

## Game Session Start
Unless stated otherwise, you always begin the game at HQ.

You begin the game by revealing the HQ world map tile to all players. Place the HQ tile at the world map center tile position, reading any read-aloud text listed in your setting handbook for the start of the game.

## Game Session End
Unless stated otherwise, you always end the game at HQ. The following occurs when PCs return to HQ:
1. All ongoing encounter powers, abilities, and features end.
2. PCs may pay 1 Coin for rest and repairs.
3. PCs take one downtime round (worker placement) by placing their token on a building within HQ (or linked through HQ at a satellite location).
4. PCs gain the benefits of completing a long rest.

(floating section)
# Between Adventures
At the start of a player's downtime round, that player may (board game: choose and place a worker from their character sheet on the appropriate regions on the HQ map) choose and gain the benefits of one downtime activity (see below). All PCs have this basic option no matter how many coins they have.

## Spending Coin
After the conclusion of a 5eFP session, players take 1 or more rounds of downtime. At the start of the downtime phase, PCs each roll a d20, adding the number of coins they currently have as a modifier. This number represents their downtime initiative. Each rolls a d20 and adds the number of Coins they currently have. This is called the downtime initiative, or just initiative.

## Downtime Activities
Whenever a PC chooses a specific downtime activity, it cannot be chosen again until the beginning of the next round of downtime. During a round of downtime, a PC can perform the following actions:

- **1 Action.** Choose and gain the benefit of 1 downtime activity.
- **1 Reaction.** You have one reaction during a round of downtime. Once you use your reaction, you cannot do so again until the beginning of the next round of downtime.
- **1 Bonus Action.** You may perform one bonus action during a round of downtime.
- **1 Object Interaction.** You may equip or unequip one item.

### Crafting
Choose this option to create items used in the game.

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every round of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one item. The cost of creating some items requires spending more than one downtime round.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have the relevant tools equipped and are working together in the same place. Each additional character contributes +1 downtime round toward crafting the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities contribute +3 downtime rounds toward crafting a suit of plate armor. Crafting plate armor requires 6 rounds of downtime.
While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

Whenever you choose the crafting downtime activity, you can choose to create any 1 of the following items, provided you meet the prerequisites:

**Healing Potion.** You create a minor healing potion.
- (a) herbalism kit equiped and (b) 1 herbs trade good equipped, or (a) healer class

**Holy Water.** You create holy water.
- healer class or
- (a) acolyte bakground and (b) temple building

**Trade Goods.** You harvest, gather, or forge trade goods. Remove 1 trade good from your inventory: gain +1 round of downtime activity. Required:
- (a) guild artisan background and (b) artisan guildhall building, or
- (a) 1 trade good in your inventory and (b) the relevant tool is equipped

**.**

### Practicing a Profession
You gain the benefits of rest and repairs without spending 1 Coin.

Roll a Performance check and 

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

### Researching


### Training



~~Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.
One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.~~

# Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

## Armor Training (Heavy)
_Prerequisite: Proficiency with medium armor_

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and shields. At the beginning of each of your turns, if you are wearing heavy armor, you gain **bolster 1**.

## Armor Training (Medium)
_Prerequisite: Proficiency with light armor_

You gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. Increase your maximum DEX bonus allowed while wearing medium armor by +1. Medium armor no longer imposes disadvantage on performance checks.

## Armor Training (Light)
You gain proficiency with light armor.

## Grappler
_Prerequisite: STR +1 or higher_

You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-­quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.

---

# Making An Attack
## Two-Weapon Fighting (needs playtesting)
~~When	you	take	the	Attack	action	and	attack	with	a	light	melee	weapon	that	you’re	holding	in	one	hand,	you	can	use	a	bonus	action	to	attack	with	a	different light melee	weapon	that	you’re	holding	in	the	other	hand.	You	don’t	add	your	ability	modifier	to	the	damage	of	the	bonus	attack,	unless	that	modifier	is	negative.~~

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand.

If	either	weapon	has	the	thrown	property,	you	can	throw	the	weapon,	instead	of	making	a	melee	attack	with	it.

(floating section)
# Encounters
5eFP uses encounters to describe the adversity PCs find while exploring maps. Traps, unfavorable environmental conditions, creatures, and challenging story situations are all considered encounters. Use the following table to determine the base statistics for all encounters. Except for forced movement, minion damage, and minion MAX wounds, add LEVEL to the base values.

|   |**Minion**|**Elite**|**Boss**|
|--:|:----:|:---:|:--:|
|**Armor Class (AC)**|12|13|14|
|**Difficulty Class (DC)**|12|13|14|
|**Bonus**|+2|+3|+4|
|**Damage**|1|0|1|
|**MAX Wounds**|1|2|4|
|**Forced Movement**|1|1 or 2|2|

**Minion.** Minions represent simple encounters. Monster encounters treat minions as creatures with minimal stats that can only sustain one point of damage with MAX wounds of 1. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must meet a single challenge to overcome the encounter. Examples: a trap that does not reset or picking a lock. While minion monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster encounters may take minutes to resolve.

**Elite.** Elites represent advanced encounters. Monster encounters treat elites as creatures with advanced stats and features. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must overcome adversity several times before achieving completion. Examples: convince a skeptical creature of something or gather clues. While elite monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster elite encounters may take an hour to resolve.

**Boss.** Bosses represent difficult encounters. Monster encounters treat bosses as creatures with advanced tactics benefiting from the presence of one or more minions. Non-monster encounters represent difficult situations where PCs must overcome challenging conditions several times while also dealing with some simultaneous minion encounters. Examples: attempt to sway the opinion of an adversary and associated followers or put out a fire spreading through a village while rescuing trapped villagers. While boss monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster boss encounters may take several hours to resolve.

**LEVEL.** The current level of play.

**Armor Class (AC).** If the PCs take action against an encounter resulting in a melee or ranged attack, they must hit an AC equal to this number to succeed.

**Difficulty Class (DC).** If an encounter requires a saving throw or skill check, set the DC to this number.

**Bonus.** If any part of an encounter relies on a modifier to a d20 roll, it uses this number as the modifier.

**Damage.** If any part of the encounter deals damage, it deals a number of points of damage equal to this number.

**MAX Wounds.** If any part of the encounter can sustain points of damage, it gains MAX wounds equal to this number. Any PC action taken to end an encounter is considered damage. Thus, a diplomatic crisis may have a MAX wounds stat representing how many times the PCs must affect the encounter before it resolves.

**Forced Movement.** If any part of the encounter imposes forced movement, this number represents the number of squares of forced movement. If no direction is stated, the movement is a push.

## Customizing Encounters
The encounter statistics provided represent average values. Any number of statistics may be increased by up to +(LEVEL), provided the same amount decreases another statistic. Only stats used in an encounter can be customized. For example, during a level 1 monster encounter, the GM increases an awakened shrub minion's AC by +1. The cost of increasing the minion's AC is paid by the GM choosing to decrease the awakened shrub minion's attack modifier by -1. In this example, the GM couldn't decrease the DC stat by -1 because the awakened shrub minion doesn't possess a stat using a DC. However, if the encounter includes a condition or effect requiring a saving throw to resist, the DC stat can be decreased by -1.

A minion's MAX wounds or damage cannot be customized.

Encounter elements cannot be reduced below the following values:
- **Speed** 2
- **MAX Wounds (elite)** 2
- **MAX Wounds (boss)** 5 
- **DC** 12 (minion), 13 (elite), 14 (boss)
- **Damage** 1

# Encounter Type
Encounter type describes what kind of encounter it is.

## Monster
A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

>Monster encounters use one of three templates:
>
>- **Minion.** Place (number of PCs + 1) minions onto the playing field.
>- **Elite.** As **Minion** plus add 2 elites onto the playing field.
>- **Boss.** As **Minion** plus add 1 boss onto the playing field adjacent to a minion.

### Size

### Type
A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also to other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals or the Primordials. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The genie species, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid species are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

#### Tags
A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment
A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-­‐‑aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.

### Speed
A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn measured in squares.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-­based locomotion have a walking speed of 0.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

#### Burrow
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.

#### Fly
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

#### Swim
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA) and corresponding modifiers.

### Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its WIS saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

### Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Perception and Performance checks.

Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-­than-­expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

### Senses
The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

#### Blindsight
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

#### Darkvision
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

>#### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies
>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.

#### Tremorsense
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

#### Truesight
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.

#### Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.

### Challenge
When determining the challenge of a monster encounter, let *N* equal the number of PCs + 1.

An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of adventurers should be able to defeat *N* minions, *N* minions and two elites, or *N* minions and one boss without suffering any deaths.

### Special Traits
Special traits (which appear before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.

A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells.

#### Spellcasting
A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.

A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-­level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-­level spell by using one of its 5th-­level spell slots.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its description.

#### Psionics
A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see (TBD).

**Creature vs. Target.** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

**Hit.** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation.

**Miss.** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.

#### Multiattack
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. Defeated monsters using ammunition drop (basic ammunition).

### Reactions
If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**Bolster X.** The notation "Bolster X" means a monster can use a special pool of points to reduce incoming damage. As long as this creature has a bolster pool of 1 or more, it may assign 1 or more bolster points as a free action and reduce incoming damage by 1 for each point spent. Spent points are lost. Whenever a creature has two or more bolster pools, it keeps the largest bolster pool and discards the rest.

For example, "Bolster 2" means a monster can use up to 2 bolster points as a free action to reduce incoming damage by an amount equal to the number of bolster points spent. If the creature uses 1 bolster point, it then has "Bolster 1." If it later gains "Bolster 2," the creature gains "Bolster 2" and discards "Bolster 1."

**X/Game.** The notation “X/Game” means a special ability or feature can only be used X number of times during one 5eFP game session.

**Recharge X–Y.** The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll three action dice. If the number of actions equals one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short rest.

For example, “Recharge 3–4” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls 3 or 4 actions after rolling three action dice.

**Recharge after a Short Rest.** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short rest to use it again.

>#### Grapple Rules for Monsters
>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.
>
>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a contested Performance check.

### Equipment
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.

## Bosses are Legendary Creatures
Bosses are legendary creatures because they can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. They can take special actions outside their turn, and they might exert magical or mundane influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a boss, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

### Legendary Actions
A boss can take a certain number of special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.

### A Boss' Lair
A boss might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a boss that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Regional Effects
The mere presence of a boss can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the boss is defeated.

### Monster Descriptions
All monster descriptions are detailed in Appendix MM.

## Dungeon
Dungeon encounters use the encounter stats provided to determine the strength of any monsters, traps, and other adversity found in one floor of a contained, multi-room structure. Details such as light levels, room height, wall and floor composition, and type of doors in the dungeon are described first.

If a dungeon contains a passage leading to a higher or lower floor of the dungeon, LEVEL increases by +3. Floor changes are cumulative if they advance in the same direction. If a set of stairs in a level 1 dungeon leads down two floors, the new floor would be a LEVEL + 6 (level 7) area. While searching the level 7 floor, the PCs find a rope leading up through a hole in the floor. They climb the rope and find themselves on a level 4 floor. Then, if the PCs found a staircase leading up, the next floor would return to a level 1 area.

Dungeons may have one or more bonus features.

**Danger Room.** These rooms are always obscured by a reinforced and locked door or an opaque phenomenon keeping creatures out that is clearly labeled as deadly. PCs must first acknowledge the warnings to enter a danger room. Acknowledgment unlocks the door or phenomenon, allowing passage. If the PCs advance into a danger room, they must face a boss battle at difficulty (LEVEL + 2). The way out vanishes the moment the PCs reach the danger room and does not reappear until the end of the encounter. The monster encounter is set up as if there are five PCs (even if the party is less than five) and two bonus elites are added to the encounter. If the PCs overcome the encounter, an unlocked, trap-free ornate chest appears. Each PC may, in turn, approach the chest and open it. The PC then chooses and adds one treasure to their equipment from three discovered treasures (roll once on mundane treasures for their class, once on advanced treasures for their class, and once for magic items).

# Appendix PHS
# Spellcasting
Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.

This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

## What Is a Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-­A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.

### Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-­shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least level 2, not level 3, to cast a 3rd-­level spell and the most powerful spells, 9th-level, usually become available during character level 6.

### Known and Prepared Spells
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-­using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on how many Magic feature upgrades a character unlocks with Coin.

### Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-­level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-­level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-­level spell fits only in a 9th-­level slot. So when Umara casts _magic missile_, a 1st-­level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-­level slots and has three remaining.

Spell slots restore after recalling to HQ.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts _magic missile_ using one of her 2nd-­level slots, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

>#### Casting in Armor
>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

### Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.

### Rituals
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.

Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.
Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

## Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

#### Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like _magic missile_, the target is a creature. For a spell like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in squares. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the _shield_ spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components
A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

#### Material (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.

### Duration
A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be the length of an encounter or the length of a game session. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Encounter
A number of spells have durations longer than an instant but shorter than a game session. These spells persist for the length of an encounter. Whenever you cast these spells while on the overland movement map of a world map tile, their effects remain as long as you do not change maps. If you change maps due to a random encounter or by entering a foothold, the spell's duration ends when you resolve the random encounter or when you complete the foothold.

#### Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Recall
Some spells have have lingering effects. A spell with a duration of recall lasts until the PCs recall back to HQ. 

#### Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take one or more wounds while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a CON saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 9 + the number of wounds received. If you take wounds from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-­tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 CON saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

### Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect
Spells such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

#### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 1 square of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.

>#### The Schools of Magic
>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
>
>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
>
>**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
>
>**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
>
>**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
>
>**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
>**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
>
>**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
>
>**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
>
>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.
>
>**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

### Combining Magical Effects
The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 12|
|**Components:** V, S|

|_2nd-level abjuration_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)|

#### Alarm
|_1st-­level abjuration (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 minute|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.|
|A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.|
|An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 12 feet.|

#### Alter Self
|_2nd-­level transmutation_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V, S|
|**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour|
||
|You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.|
|**Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.|
|**Change Appearance.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.|
|**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice.
Your unarmed strikes deal 1 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.|

#### Animal Friendship
|_1st-­level enchantment_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.|

#### Animal Messenger
|_2nd-­level enchantment (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-­haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-­five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering 2 world map tiles for a flying messenger, or 1 world map tile for other animals. When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.|
|**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the distance the animal messenger travels increases by +1 world map tile for each slot level above 2nd.|

#### Arcane Lock
|_2nd-level abjuration_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)|
|**Duration:** Until dispelled|
||
|You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 1 square of the object, suppresses this spell long enough to allow passage. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for the rest of the encounter.|
|While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.|

#### Arcanist’s Magic Aura
|_2nd-­level illusion_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.|
|When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.|
|**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.|
|**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.|

#### Augury
|_2nd-­level divination (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V, S, M (talisman)|
|**Duration:** Instantaneous|
||
|By casting gem-­inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take before recalling back to HQ. The GM rolls an action die (d6) and compares the number of bolt symbols to the following possible omens:|
||
- 1 (1 bolt): Weal, for good results
- 6 (2 bolts): Woe, for bad results
- 2-5 (blank): Mixed or unclear results

|  |
|:-|
|The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.|
|The GM makes any necessary adjustments to the narrative to incorporate these readings into the story.|

|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|

|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|

|**At Higher Levels.** At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.|

#### Blindness/Deafness
|_2nd-­level necromancy_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Encounter|
||
|You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a CON saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a CON saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.|

||
|Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.|

#### Branding Smite
|_2nd-­level evocation_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|
||
|The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike.

|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by +1 for each slot level above 2nd|

||
|As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 3-­square cone must make a DEX saving throw. A creature takes 1 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (minimum 1 damage). The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by +1 for each slot level above 1st.|

Calm Emotions
2nd-­‐‑level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

# 5eFP SRD \[playtest]

Welcome to the fifth edition focus practice (5eFP), a new tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) experience combining fun and immersive gameplay with deepening levels of self-exploration.

Inspired by the d20 fifth edition rules, 5eFP emerges as a completely new body of work whose core rules are system agnostic. Freely use these rules within any interactive storytelling game seeking 5eFP wisdom.

***Focus.*** Learning and gaining proficiency requires focus, time, and attention. Focus begins with cultivating greater awareness of thoughts, feelings, and instincts as sensations arise within the body. Reaching the next level of experience brings about greater awareness and deeper access to life's energy sourced from within ourselves.

***Practice.*** Focus alone isn't enough. Results require real doing through regular and consistent gameplay. We transform TRPGs into a mindful practice. Practices are activities we return to because they feed us in some way. Successful practices provide a kind of nutrient missing in other activities. Regularly playing 5eFP games from beginning to end, fully conscious and aware at least once per month, is our practice.

### THE FIVE SKILLS

The five skills are used in all TRPGs and interactive storytelling games. 5eFP skills grant deeper story access and greater player agency while encouraging their growth within the player characters (PCs) and our real life (RL). The five skills remind us of our abilities and our free agency.

### INSPIRATION

5eFP games use inspiration points. At the start of each game, the game master (GM) awards one inspiration point to PCs with one or fewer inspiration points. Each player (GM included) then chooses and dedicates two of the five skills by saying them out loud to one another.

PCs may spend inspiration at any time during the game to activate an inspired version of a 5eFP skill dedicated at the beginning of the game. PCs regain use of this feature at the beginning of their next turn.

Alternatively, PCs may save up to 2 inspiration points for later. Any unused inspiration points carry over to the next game.

Items, effects, or features within the game may provide exceptions to these rules.

### SKILL DESCRIPTIONS

***Insight.*** Your insight imbues inward sight, granting vision beneath surface impressions.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character can easily determine sincerity, true motives, and intentions within the current scene. Illusions, misdirections, disguises, or actions with the intent to deceive appear transparent to you. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Medicine.*** Your medicine stabilizes wounds.
>>> INSPIRED: Choose any number of targets your character can see within 30 feet who are unconscious or dying. Each target immediately stabilizes and wakes up with minimum health.

***Perception.*** Your perception enables you to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character receives all available pieces of information regarding the current scene. Hidden doors, creatures, traps, ambushes, whispered conversations. Anything arising from sense data or information gained through the five senses. Your GM refunds your inspiration if no additional information is gained.

***Performance.*** Your performance allows the satisfying completion of one action.
>>> INSPIRED: Whenever your character declares an action on their turn, you may use this feature to decide the outcome of the action and whether or not it was successful. You must choose to use your inspiration in this way before rolling any dice and before the game master declares the result of your action.

***Survival.*** Your survival awards expanded capacities, allowing you to identify and acquire new advantages, qualities, or skills.
>>> INSPIRED: Your character finds a path leading to another desired location on the current map. The revealed path is one of many potential pathways. This is the swiftest path. </br></br>
>>> Once per game session, you can use your inspired 5eFP Survival to activate the inspired version of a 5eFP skill you didn't dedicate at the beginning of the game.

# Sample Setting Handbook
## Enchanted Forest
The Enchanted Forest's beloved Enchantress Queen (Queen) falls gravely ill as waves of weary and injured refugees enter through all four charmed gates of Castle Somnam (HQ), bringing harrowed tales of encroaching darkness. The Nightmare, a darkly magical reality overlaying the world and the realm known as the Plane of Shadow (Shadowfell), breached the Enchanted Forest's borders, spreading its long shadows across the land and transforming all it touched into strange and twisted reflections. The realm is no longer as it once was. Castle Somnam remains the only location unaffected by the Nightmare, thanks to the monarch's mystical protections imbued within the city castle's walls. An elite assembly of champions, known as the Queen's Heralds (Heralds), are charged with keeping the realm and its people healthy, thriving, and safe from harm.

You joined the Queen's Heralds and now, just before your graduation, you are called to participate in one important, final test: you must travel to the Crypt of the Continual Flame on foot deep into the Megalithic Highlands. You and your friends must make the journey alone unaided by your fellow students, peers, and instructors. You must make your way to the Crypt using a simple map. There, you will light your torch within the Hall of the Continual Flame and return it as proof of completion. Only then do you officially become a Herald.

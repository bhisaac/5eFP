## Safe Space and Code Of Conduct

5eFP contributors, facilitators, and participants strive to create physical and virtual spaces where people have fun and feel safe. 5eFP game masters (GMs) take it very seriously if any player feels threatened or uncomfortable by another person in their space. When a GM is made aware of situations related to this, they will make sure that your concerns are heard and will take the necessary steps with you to respond to the problem. A 5eFP GM expects all participants to respect one another and to address unacceptable behaviors, including those instigated or perpetuated by the GM.

# Introduction

The Five Energies Focus Practice (5eFP) is a tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) that combines fun and immersive gameplay with deepening levels of self-exploration. 5eFP can be played for fun, self-reflection, mindfulness, or all three. [5eFP's dedication and inspiration rules are system-agnostic and can be used with any TRPG](https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/main/5eFP-SRD.md#inspiration).

_**Five Energies.**_ 5eFP is based on and inspired by the D20 fifth edition rules, which condenses all traditional D20 fifth edition skills into five essentials universal to all TRPGS: Insight, Medicine, Perception, Performance, and Survival. Skills are energies we use to affect change in the 5eFP game and real life (RL). Five Energies also refers to five elemental qualities: earth, water, fire, air, and aether.

_**Focus.**_ Learning and gaining proficiency requires focus, time, and attention. Focus begins with cultivating greater awareness of thoughts, feelings, and instincts as sensations arise within the body. Reaching the next level of experience brings about greater awareness and deeper access to life's energy sourced from within ourselves.

_**Practice.**_ Focus alone isn't enough. Results require real doing through regular and consistent gameplay. We transform TRPGs into mindful practices. Practices are activities we return to because they feed us in some way. Successful practices provide a nutrient missing in other activities. Our practice is regularly playing 5eFP games from beginning to end, fully conscious and aware at least once per month.

Read more about the focus practice in [Appendix PR-A: Running the Focus Practice](https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/main/5eFP-SRD.md#appendix-fp-a-running-the-focus-practice).

## Common Terms

The 5eFP TRPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.

**_Action_.** An action is a discrete measurement of time accessible during your turn and typically resolves before the end of your turn. You discard your action when you use certain game features, cast spells, and make attacks. You regain your action at the beginning of your next turn (see Actions). If a game feature has the action keyword, you must discard your action to use it, and you may take additional actions detailed in its description without needing to discard your action.

**_Action Dice_.** Action dice are special six-sided dice with four blank faces, one side with one lightning bolt symbol, and one side with two lightning bolt symbols. The symbols can represent +1 (one symbol) or +2 (two symbols) or additional options depending on the action using them. Alternatively, you can use regular six-sided dice and assign these results to 1 and 2, respectively, with the remaining values representing blank faces.

**_Ability Score_.** Six ability scores ranging from -5 to +10 provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics, including strength (STR) measuring physical power, dexterity (DEX) measuring agility, constitution (CON) measuring endurance, intelligence (INT) measuring reasoning and memory, wisdom (WIS) measuring awareness, and charisma (CHA) measuring force of personality.

**_Bolster_.** Bolster points help protect you from wounds. The number next to the bolster keyword indicates how many points you have. If you take wounds, you spend your bolster points first to reduce them. Each bolster point you spend reduces the number of wounds assigned to you by 1. Remaining wounds are then assigned as normal.

**_Coin_ (⛁).** A 5eFP game awards and uses Coin (⛁) as its currency, representing wealth, reputation, and experience.

**_Cooldown_.** A game feature with the cooldown keyword can only be used once during a game session. If a number follows the cooldown keyword, the number represents how many times you can use the game feature during a game session (minimum 1). Once a game feature with a cooldown is used, you can't use it again until the beginning of your next turn. For example, Cooldown 2 means you can use this game feature twice per game session but no more than once per turn.

**_Conflict_.** The conflict, detailed in your setting handbook, is an event with ongoing effects that changed the game world into an unbalanced and afflicted state (see Setting Handbook). A 5eFP game ends when the conflict is resolved.

**_Creature and Monster_.** A creature can be a player character or a non-player character. It can also be a monster or a minion, elite, or boss in a monster encounter. Creatures and monsters can be good, neutral, or evil. They can be lawful or chaotic as well. The majority are neutral, meaning they are not good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. Sometimes, the label fits. Some creatures are frightening and terrible, and some monsters are, indeed, monsters.

**_Defense_.** Your Defense equals 10 + DEX and can prevent attacks from hitting you.

**_Difficulty Class (DC)_.** Difficulty Class or DC represents a task's difficulty. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC.

**_Deploy (Cooldown)_.** After choosing an unexplored world map tile, the PCs deploy onto its exploration map by placing the group token in a random location. The obscuring map tile under the group token is revealed. Explored world map tiles sometimes provide additional locations for placing your character during a downtime round. These bonus areas are placed along the sides of the world map. PCs may deploy onto these special areas before resolving a downtime round.

**_Discover._** If a game feature instructs you to discover something, you determine two results, choose one, and discard the rest.

**_Downtime_.** Downtime consists of downtime actions measured in rounds, including rest and repairs, research, spending Coin on HQ upgrades, or taking other actions between game sessions.

**_Encounter_.** An encounter is a significant occurrence within the game where the outcome of events is uncertain and is measured in rounds. PCs are awarded ⛁ when an encounter ends. Game features with the encounter keyword reset at the beginning of an encounter, can only be used once during an encounter, and, unless otherwise stated, persist until the end of an encounter. If a number follows the encounter keyword, it represents the number of times you can use the feature during an encounter, but never more than once per turn.

**_Encounter, Campfire_.** Campfire encounters are special encounters that grant the benefits of a rest without counting against the number of allowed rests in a game session, don't need a map to resolve, don't award Coin when completed, may include social interaction between PCs, may or may not include an actual campfire, and do not advance the time marker, revealing obscuring map tiles up to 3 squares away when finished.

**_Fast Travel_.** 5eFP games use fast travel rules when deploying onto the world map, skipping past traveling and travel times.

**_Foothold_.** A foothold is an encounter connected to the conflict outlined in your setting handbook. PCs must find and resolve three footholds to finish exploring an obscured world map tile.

**_Gamemaster (GM)_.** A gamemaster or GM is a player who is proficient in the game's rules and can facilitate 5eFP game sessions within a 5eFP practice. The other players in a 5eFP practice play player characters while the GM plays everything else.

**_Group Token_.** A special game token representing all of the PCs within a group.

**_Headquarters (HQ)_.** Each world map has an HQ, usually located at the center of the map, representing the central organization or organizing force responsible for maintaining the health and security of the game world or region. All PCs are peers and colleagues within this organization. You are objectively safe from the conflict at HQ, provided HQ receives the setting handbook requirement. Unless stated otherwise, PCs always begin and end a game session at HQ.

**_LEVEL_.** LEVEL equals the current level of play. LEVEL starts at 1 and increases over time to 7 as game objectives are completed.

**_Line of Sight (LOS)_.** A target is within your line of sight if it is visible and not behind total cover. Certain game features, weapons, and spells target with a range of line of sight.

**_Mana_.** Mana is a reserve of energy used to fuel spells or other preternatural game features.

**_Map, Encounter_.** You set up a 14-square by 14-square encounter map near the exploration map when an encounter is revealed. Each square within the map is measured 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters. Unlike the exploration map, you do not cover this map with obscuring map tiles.

**_Map, Exploration_.** The players prepare an exploration map When PCs deploy onto an obscured world map tile. This map is a top-down illustration of a specific area on the world map divided into a 14-square by 14-square map. Each square within the map is measured 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters. The exploration map begins covered by obscuring map tiles.

**_Map, World_.** The world map defines the game world and drives the game's story. It is a top-down illustration of the game world or region divided into a 14-square by 14-square grid. Each square within the grid is measured 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters.

**_MAX Wounds_.** If the number of wounds you have equals your MAX Wounds score, you fall unconscious and make death saves at the beginning of each turn.

**_Minion, Elite, and Boss_.** All three refer to encounter difficulty, typically referring to monsters found in monster encounters. Minions are manageable encounters that take only one successful hit or ability check to resolve. Elites are advanced encounters with improved abilities that typically require two or more successful hits or ability checks to resolve. Bosses are the most advanced and challenging encounters that typically require multiple hits and ability checks to resolve, have special abilities that exploit minions, always include a minion encounter, and may have up to two elites.

**_Non-Player Character (NPC)_.** A character created and played by the gamemaster.

**_Obscuring Map Tiles_.** Obscuring map tiles are two-sided opaque map tiles that cover unexplored areas of a map or may represent areas of preternatural or magical darkness.

**_Player Character (PC)_.** A character created and played by a player.

**_Proficiencies_.** If you are proficient with a game feature, you can use it without penalty and add LEVEL to any attack or ability check you make using it. You can only add LEVEL to a proficiency once.

**_Recall (Cooldown)_.** A PC is transported back to the HQ map room after finishing a special Recall ritual completed outside of an encounter. All PCs instantly Recall when completing this ritual or whenever the time marker reaches 8. A game feature with the Recall keyword persists until you Recall.

**_Rest (Cooldown 2)_.** While deployed and not in an encounter, a group can choose to take a rest. A rest is a brief period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. At the end of a rest, a creature discards up to LEVEL wounds and regains all uses of game features with the rest keyword. If a number follows the rest keyword, it represents the number of times the game feature can be used between rests, but no more than once per turn. Finishing a rest advances the time marker.

**_Round_.** In combat and other fast-­paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-­second span of time. A downtime round represents one or more days.

**_Setting Handbook_.** All details about the 5eFP practice you are joining, including read-aloud text, GM contact information, game backstory, world map, whether the game includes faith, HQ information, how the practice refers to Coin, the game's central conflict, the game's story directions, how PC Recall, how PCs fast travel, and the setting handbook requirement can be found in your setting handbook.

**_Setting Handbook Requirement_.** PCs must complete this special task each game session, which might involve, but isn't limited to, placing and using an item, locating and gathering an item, finding and rescuing bystanders, gathering intelligence, or gathering a resource. For example, PCs must find and gather an herb, a starflower, in the _Enchanted Forest_ setting.

**_Story Directions_.** The world map has four cardinal directions: North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W). Each cardinal direction is linked to a unique story corresponding to that direction. There are also four ordinal or hybrid directions: Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), Southwest (SW), and Northwest (NW). Each hybrid direction is linked to the stories contained within adjacent directions.

**_Story Elements_.** Story elements are pieces of the overall story relating to the game's conflict, modified by the particular direction the PCs are exploring. Over time, these story elements automatically create stories of their own.

**_Time Marker_.** Keep track of how long PCs are deployed on an unexplored world map tile. The time marker begins at 0 and increases by +1 when an encounter is resolved or after a rest. If three footholds are resolved and the PCs reveal additional footholds, each increases the time marker by +1. When the time marker reaches 8, all PCs instantaneously Recall.

**_Toggle_.** A game feature with the toggle keyword is considered deactivated or off until you spend your action to turn it on or activate it. While off, the game feature provides no benefits or effects as if it had no features. Once activated, follow the effects described within the feature, which persist until the feature is deactivated. You can deactivate a feature with toggle at the beginning of your turn (no action required). Features with the toggle keyword begin a game session toggled off.

**_Turn_.** During a round, a creature takes its turn, during which it can spend a wide variety of actions. Usually, over the course of one turn, a creature can take an action, use an object, or take a reaction (see Actions). A game feature with the turn keyword can only be used once. Any bonuses or penalties it provides remain in effect until the beginning of your next turn. You regain the ability to use a game feature with the turn keyword at the start of your turn.

**_Upgrade_.** Once the PCs Recall, they may spend Coin unlocking character upgrades. Available upgrades include class and species, and are limited to only those upgrades equal to or less than LEVEL. Once all PCs stop spending Coin on character upgrades, downtime begins.

**_Wounds_.** Any damage assigned to you that you cannot reduce or prevent is converted to an equal number of wounds.

**_World Map Tile_.** A square on the world map. A world map tile can either be explored or unexplored. An obscuring map tile covers unexplored world map tiles.

# Round Down

Some game features ask you to divide a number by half or more. Whenever you divide a number, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

# Character Creation

## Ability Scores

Whenever you create a new character, assign ability scores using the standard array: (+2, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1)

Choose and place each score as desired. Two ability scores represent advanced ability and talent (+2), another two represent aptitude (+1), another ability score represents average ability (+0), and the last ability score is challenged by adversity and unfavorable circumstances (-1).

## Attack Roll Modifier

After assigning ability scores, choose DEX or STR. You use the chosen ability score for melee and ranged attack rolls.

# Species

## Species Traits

The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase

Every species increases one character’s ability score by +1.

### Favored Ability

Most species also grant another favored ability score that gains an additional +1 if you assign a +1 or greater score during character creation.

### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment

Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

### Size

Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Unless your species has a speed section, your speed is 6 squares, representing the maximum number of squares you can move during your turn.

### Languages

All PCs, regardless of species, speak a common language, typically referred to as common.

### Varieties

Some species have one or more varieties. Each variety has the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their variety. Relationships among varieties differ significantly from species to species and world to world.

## Dwarf

### Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution (CON) score increases by +1.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

### Highlander Dwarf

As a highlander dwarf, you are accustomed to rugged living at high altitudes and within mountain dwellings.

## Elf

### Elf Traits

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, a result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score (DEX) increases by +1.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Keen Senses.** You gain advantage on WIS checks to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.

Additionally, during a downtime round, whenever you spend ⛁ on rest and repairs, you may spend any number of Coin on one bonus downtime activity of your choice. You must still satisfy any prerequisites the bonus downtime activity may have before spending the extra Coin.

### High Elf

As a high elf, you have strong ties to nature and magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other species.

**Favored Ability.** Intelligence (INT)

**Arcane Attunement.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. INT is your spellcasting ability for it.

### Wood Elf

As a wood elf, you have deep awareness and intuition, and your attunement to nature carries you quickly and stealthily through natural terrain. Wood elves tend to be reclusive and distrustful of non-elves.

**Favored Ability.** Wisdom (WIS)

# Barbarian Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|2⛁|-|Reckless Attack|...|
|2⛁|-|Danger Sense|You gain advantage to DEX checks vs. effects you can see|
|2⛁|-|Primal Path|...|

## Reckless Attack (Toggle)

You can throw aside all concern for protection to attack with fierce determination. You gain advantage on weapon attack rolls using STR, but attack rolls against you have advantage. You then take the Attack action.

## Primal Path

You choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Spirit Warrior.

## Path of the Berserker

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end. The Path of the Berserker is a path of unleashed fury.

### Frenzy (Action, Encounter)

You expend one use of your rage feature and go into a frenzy. For the duration of your rage, you can make a single melee weapon attack after you take the Attack action. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in Appendix PH-­A).

## Path of the Spirit Warrior

You forge a spiritual and inspired connection to an elemental spirit that takes on the appearance of an animal in your dreams and visions, functioning as a friend, guide, and protector. In battle, your spirit guide enhances your abilities, adding a touch of magic to your barbarian rage.

### Spirit Seeker

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. You gain the ability to cast the _beast link_ and _speak with animals_ spells, but only as rituals (see _Spellcasting_).

### Elemental Spirit (Rage)

When you adopt this path, you choose an elemental spirit and gain its game feature. Your elemental spirit provides you with a physical object that symbolically and mystically represents your bond—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates treasures of the natural world like crystals, stones, herbs, cuttings, fur, feathers, or other natural trinkets reminiscent of your chosen elemental spirit.

Your elemental spirit might be related to those listed here, but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a sand elemental or a mud elemental instead of an earth elemental.

**_Earth_.** You have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The earth spirit makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

**_Air_.** The air spirit lets you weave through the fray with ease. You gain the following features while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

- When you declare an Attack action on your turn, you may take the Dash action without needing to discard your action before or after making your attack.

**_Water_.** Allies within 1 square of you gain advantage on melee attack rolls while you aren't incapacitated. The water spirit makes you a leader of hunters.

**_Fire_ (Action, Rest 2).** The fire spirit grants you a fire attack with reach. You increase your range to up to 2 squares and then take the Attack action. The damage of your attack changes to fire.

### Spells Known

You know CHA (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the bard spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

## Bardic Action Dice (Action, Cooldown CHA, Turn)

You can inspire others by stirring words or music. Choose one creature other than yourself within 10 squares of you who can hear you. That creature gains five of your action dice. You may then take one additional action.

During the affected creature's turn, it can roll any of your action dice and add the result to an ability check or attack roll it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use any of your action dice, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once your action dice are rolled, they are returned to you. If the creature has one or more of your action dice and gains more, it decides whether to keep the ones it has or gain the new ones. Any discarded or unused action dice are returned to you.

## Magic Performance

Your bardic magic lets you use your voice or any instrument you wield more effectively. You roll with advantage whenever you make CHA checks with your voice or an instrument you're wielding.

## Resonant (Action, Encounter)

You can use your voice and musical instruments to great effect. You can have up to three musical instruments from bagpipes, drum, dulcimer, flute, lute, lyre, horn, pan flute, shawm, or viol in your inventory without them counting against your equipment slots.

If a game feature has the resonant keyword, you can affect it using your voice or musical instruments, such as sharing a stirring speech or a musical performance, provided you aren't prevented from making sounds. If you use this feature this way, you make a CHA check. A success counts as two successes, and a critical success satisfies all requirements to resolve the conflict within the encounter.

## Subtlety (Toggle)

_Prerequisites: damage or healer group role_

You must have cover or be out of LOS from any hostile creatures to activate this feature. While subtlety is activated, your movements and actions become obscured, cloaked from view, and easily overlooked. If a hostile minion or elite targets you while another target is within LOS, it must choose a different target, if possible. Your speed is reduced to half (minimum 2) while this feature is activated. You then take one action. If you take the Attack action or Cast a Spell action that includes a spell attack, you make your first attack with advantage, and then toggle this feature off.

If a game feature has the subtlety keyword, you can affect it using deception, sleight of hand, or stealth. If you use this feature this way, you make a CHA check for deception or a DEX check for sleight of hand or stealth. A success counts as two successes, and a critical success satisfies all requirements to resolve the conflict.

## Bard College

You delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the College of Lore.

## College of Lore

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
 
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.

The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-­important figures of authority.

### Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with one ability of your choice.

### Cutting Words (Reaction)

You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature you can see within 12 squares of you makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can expend one use of bardic action dice, rolling five action dice and subtracting the number from the creature’s roll. You can use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or is immune to being charmed. When used this way, you do not gain an additional action from your bardic action dice feature.

## Expertise

When you purchase this upgrade, you gain proficiency with a non-proficient ability. Then choose one of your ability proficiencies. You add your level to ability checks with the chosen ability twice instead of once. You cannot add your level more than twice with the chosen ability.

## Spellcasting

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. 

### Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list.

### Mana 2

To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _cure wounds_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _cure wounds_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know WIS (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the cleric spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the cleric spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity, a dedication, such as those listed in the dedication rules, or one elemental quality from earth, water, fire, air, and aether. You use your WIS whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

### Rirtual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

## Divine Domain

Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Medicine. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features.

### Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of domain spells. You always know your domain spells, which don't count against the number of spells you know.

If you gain a domain spell that isn't a cleric spell, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Medicine Domain

The Medicine domain focuses on vibrant positive energy that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

### Medicine Domain Spells

- bless
- cure wounds

### Bonus Proficiency

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Performance Medicine

Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to give a creature 1 or more healing points, the creature receives one additional healing point per spell level.

### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life (Action)

_Purchase the **Channel Divinity (Rest)** upgrade to unlock this feature._

You present your holy symbol, evoking healing energy that can provide up to 5 healing points. Choose any creatures within 6 squares of you, and divide the healing among them. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

# Cleric Upgrades

|3⛁|-|4|Magic|You learn one spell from the cleric spell list.|

## Channel Divinity (Rest)

You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you upgrade them, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.

Some Channel Divinity effects require ability checks. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell DC.

### Turn Undead (Action)

You present your holy symbol, speaking a prayer that censures undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you must make a WIS check. If the creature fails its check, it is turned until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

# Druid

As a druid, you gain the following class features. 
  
### Health

## Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful (DC 15) WIS check but can’t decipher it without magic.

## Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.

### Mana 2

To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _cure wounds_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _cure wounds_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know WIS (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the druid spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the druid spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your WIS whenever a druid spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

# Druid Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Mana|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|2⛁|-|-|Wild Shape|...|
|2⛁|-|-|Druid Circle|...|
|3⛁|-|4|Magic|You learn one spell from the druid spell list.|

## Wild Shape (Action, Rest 2)

You magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. When you use this feature, save and set aside any wounds and choose a wild shape form. Use statistics for an elite creature except as detailed below. Your wild shape form cannot benefit from any swim or fly speeds it may have.
 
## Wild Shape Forms

Wild shapes are divided into three primary forms: tough, stealthy, and travel.

### Tough

You have 5 + LEVEL MAX wounds and Defense 11 while in tough form. Your size changes to large if it is not already, with a reach of 1 square. You gain Bolster LEVEL when you assume this form.

### Stealthy

You have 4 + LEVEL MAX wounds and Defense 12 + LEVEL while in stealthy form. While in this form, you roll DEX checks with advantage.
 
### Travel

You can activate travel form outside of an encounter when you are the group token controller. You have 1 MAX wounds while in travel form. When activated, you and any chosen friendly and willing creatures within 6 squares of you transform into travel forms and move together. If an encounter begins or if 1 or more points of damage are dealt to you or another affected creature, your wild shape and all travel forms end. Your speed increases by +2 while in travel form.

You can stay in a wild shape form until you Recall. You then revert to your normal form. You can discard your action to revert to your normal form earlier on your turn. If you fall unconscious, gain MAX wounds, or die, you automatically revert.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the wild shape form, but you retain your alignment, personality, and INT, WIS, and CHA. You also retain all of your proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
- When you transform, you assume the wild shape form's MAX wounds. When you revert to your normal form, you return all wounds you set aside before you transformed. However, if you revert because your wild shape form gained MAX Wounds, any excess wounds carry over to your normal form. For example, if you take 2 damage in a wild shape form and have room for only 1 wound, you revert and take 1 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t cause you to reach your maximum wounds, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
- You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your wild shape form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as _call lightning_, that you’ve already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, species, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as truesight, unless your new form also has that sense.
- Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.

## Druid Circle

You choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land, the Circle of the Sun and Moon, or the Circle of the Manyshaped.
 
### Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

**_Bonus Cantrip._** When you choose this circle, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.
 
**_Natural Recovery_ (Cooldown).** You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. You gain LEVEL mana when you finish a rest.

**_Circle Spells._** Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. You gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, it becomes known. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

|Land|Circle Spells|
|:-|:-|
|Arctic|_hold person_, _spike growth_|
|Coast|_mirror image_, _misty step_|
|Desert|_blur_, _silence_|
|Forest|_barkskin_, _spider climb_|
|Grassland|_invisibility_, _pass without trace_|
|Mountain|_spider climb_, _spike growth_|
|Swamp|_acid arrow_, _darkness_|
 
### Circle of the Sun and Moon

The Circle of the Sun and Moon is made up of mystics who meditate and commune with the cosmic astral plane, using radiance and starlight to strengthen allies while hindering foes. These druids meet within sacred standing stones to observe and reflect upon the position and motion of celestial bodies in the sky. The wisest members of the circle advise rulers of communities that follow the Old Faith, and are sometimes consulted by those of different faiths. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the heavens and the astral plane.

**_Wild Shape Form: Astral Form_.** You have 2 + LEVEL MAX wounds while in astral form. You may use Wild Shape without discarding your action when shapeshifting into astral form. When you choose this form, you do not assume the shape of a beast. You and your equipment become translucent, taking on an indigo tint filled with points of moving lights. You gain the following features while in astral form.

- Your equipment and gear have the same appearance while equipped, do not merge into your astral form, and function normally.
- You may cast spells, speak, and take normal actions in astral form.
- **_Lunar Attunement._** After casting a spell with no visible effect, such as _cure wounds_, you discard solar attunement and gain lunar attunement. If you already have lunar attunement, discard it and activate _starfall_.
- **_Solar Attunement._** After casting a spell with a visible effect such as _entangle_, you discard lunar attunement and gain solar attunement. If you already have solar attunement, discard it and activate _starfall_.
- **_Starfall._** A shooting star of radiance forms above your head and strikes a creature within 12 squares of you. If the creature is friendly, it can discard up to one wound and may make an ability check to resist one ongoing negative effect. If the creature is not a friendly target, it must succeed on a DEX check using your spell DC or take 1 point of radiant damage. You then gain _lunar attunement_ or _solar attunement_.

### Circle of the Manyshaped

The Circle of the Manyshaped are fierce wilderness protectors and powerful shapeshifters who embody and cultivate wisdom within the shapes of animals. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news across the land and trade observations and insights. Their preferred way of doing this is with an assembly of crows or ravens. They can be found in the deepest parts of the wild, where they spend long periods living in a wild shape form as animals, hunting, thinking, and sleeping as animals. They do this to deepen their understanding of the animal and its relation to the animal within themselves.

**_Improved Wild Shape_.** Your Wild Shape feature drops the action keyword and changes to Wild Shape (Rest 2). Your wild shape forms gain additional game features.

> **_Renew_ (Action).** You take one action. You may spend up to LEVEL mana to discard an equal number of wild shape form wounds before or after taking the action.

**_Tough_.** You gain bolster LEVEL at the beginning of your turn. You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

**_Stealthy_.** You gain advantage on WIS checks. You gain a pounce attack (if you don't already have one).

> **_Pounce_.** Whenever you take the Attack action, move at least 3 squares in a line toward a creature, and hit it with a melee attack, it must succeed on a DC (14 + LEVEL) STR check or be knocked prone. If the creature is prone, you can make one melee attack against it.

**_Travel_.** Your movement changes to double your base speed. Once travel form is activated, it can be reactivated on the exploration map anytime outside of an encounter until you Recall. When you reactivate travel form, set aside any wild shape form you are currently in and any wild shape wounds you may have. When travel form ends due to entering an encounter or taking 1 or more points of damage, you shift back into the wild shape form and regain your wild shape wounds you set aside earlier.

# Fighter Upgrades

## Action Surge (Action, Rest)

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. You take one action. After completing the action, you may take one additional action.

## Martial Archetype

You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion or Eldritch Knight. The archetypes are described at the end of this section.

# Champion

The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

# Eldritch Knight

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines spellcasting with martial mastery common to all fighters. Eldritch Knights learn spells like wizards. Their attunement to martial mastery limits their magic studies to two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells protect, while evocation spells bring elemental energy to bear in combat, extending the fighter’s reach. These knights are dedicated to a few select spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

## Spellcasting

You blend spells with melee and ranged weapons. You can cast 1st-level spells.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### Mana 2

To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _magic missile_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _magic missile_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know three 1st-level spells from the wizard spell list, two of which must be abjuration or evocation spells.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the abjuration or evocation wizard spells you know and replace it with another abjuration or evocation spell from the wizard spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your INT whenever a wizard spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use INT when setting the DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + INT

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + INT

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

## Eldritch Weapon

You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You complete the ritual during a rest. The weapon must be within 1 square of you throughout the ritual, after which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Your bonded weapon gains the following features.

- Your bonded weapon cannot be disarmed while you have it equipped unless you are incapacitated.
- Your bonded weapon does not deplete.
- You can form a bond with up to one shield. This game feature considers a bonded shield a melee weapon with the thrown keyword and a range of up to 4 squares.
- **_Summon Eldritch Weapon (Action)_.** You take one action. If your bonded weapon is on the same plane of existence, you can summon it before or after taking your action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

With this game feature, you can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

## Unarmored Defense

While not wearing armor or wielding a shield, you add WIS (minimum 0) to your Defense.

## Martial Arts (Action)

_Prerequisites: Unarmed or monk weapons only, no armor, no shield_

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You take the Attack action and attack with an unarmed strike or monk weapon. Immediately after making your attack, you can make one additional attack with an unarmed strike. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

## Ki (Rest 2)

Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. You use this game feature to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.

You draw all of your ki back into yourself when you complete a rest in meditation.

Some of your ki features require your target to make an ability check to resist the feature’s effects. The ki DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki DC** = 10 +  WIS

Ki and ki features are considered magic and magical effects.

### Flurry of Blows (Action, Ki)

You take the Attack action. Immediately after taking the Attack action, you can make up to two unarmed strikes.

### Patient Defense (Encounter, Ki)

You can take the Dodge action without discarding your action.

### Step of the Wind (Encounter, Ki)

You can take the Disengage or Dash action without discarding your action, and your jump distance is doubled.

## Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 2 while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

## Monastic Tradition

You commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Elements, the Way of the Open Hand, and the Way of Tranquility. Your tradition grants you game features.

## Way of the Elements

You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave them together.

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.

### Disciple of the Elements

You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements.

You know the Elemental Attunement and another elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. 

Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

**_Casting Elemental Spells_.** Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells (see Spellcasting). Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your elemental discipline spells. Use your ki DC for spells that include an ability check and use 2 + WIS for your spell attack modifier. You can cast an elemental discipline spell with a spell level up to LEVEL.

### Elemental Disciplines

The elemental disciplines use your ki to produce magical effects and are presented in alphabetical order.

### Air Blast (Action, Ki)

You create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. Choose a creature within 6 squares of you. That creature must make a STR check. On a failed save, the creature takes 2 bludgeoning damage, and you can push the creature up to 4 squares away from you and knock it prone. On a successful check, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t push it or knock it prone.

### Bending Air (Action, Encounter, Ki)

You take the Cast a Spell action, innately casting _gust of wind_.

### Bending Earth (Action, Encounter, Ki)

You choose an area of earth or stone no larger than 6 squares on a side within LOS of you. You can change earth into stone within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape earth and stone in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower its elevation, move it, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed 1 square. For example, you can create a pillar 1 square high, move it by up to 1 square, dig a 1 square deep trench, and so on. You can’t shape the stone to trap or injure a creature in the area.

### Bending Fire (Encounter, Ki)

You can infuse your unarmed strikes with elemental fire, extending your reach by 2 squares for the rest of the encounter. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

### Bending Thunder (Action, Ki)

You take the Cast a Spell action, innately casting _thunderwave_.

### Bending Water (Action, Encounter, Ki)

You choose an area of ice or water no larger than 6 squares on a side within LOS of you. You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed 1 square. For example, you can create a pillar 1 square high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by 1 square, dig a 1 square deep trench, and so on. You can’t shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.

### Elemental Attunement (Action, Ki)

You briefly control elemental forces nearby, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material until you Recall.
- Cause earth, stone, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-square cube to shape itself into a crude form you desig­nate until you Recall.

If you use this game feature multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can discard your action to dismiss such an effect.

### Sweeping Fire Strike (Action, Ki)

You take the Cast a Spell action, innately casting _burning hands_.

### Water Whip (Action)

You take the Attack action, creating a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. You can use this feature before or after making an attack. A creature you can see within 6 squares of you must make a DEX check. On a failed check, the creature takes 2 bludgeoning damage, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 5 squares closer to you. On a successful check, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t pull it or knock it prone.

## Way of the Open Hand

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

### Open Hand Technique

You can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

- It must succeed on a DEX check or be knocked prone.
- It must make a STR check. If it fails, you can push it up to 3 squares away from you.
- It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

## Way of Tranquility

Monks of the Way of Tranquility eschew and abstain from violence. They use diplomacy, mercy, and understanding to resolve conflicts. If pushed, though, they are capable warriors who can bring an end to the unjust or cruel folk who refuse to listen to reason. When adventuring, these monks make excellent diplomats. They are also skilled in the healing arts and can preserve their allies during challenging encounters.

### Healing Hands (Action, Ki)

You or an ally within reach discards up to LEVEL wounds. Alternatively, you can cure a touched creature, discarding one disease or one poison affecting it. You can discard additional wounds, multiple diseases, and poisons using this game feature, expending uses of your Ki feature separately for each one.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with this feature without expending a use of your ki feature.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Path of Tranquility (Action, Recall, Rest, Ki)

You take the Cast a Spell action, innately casting _sanctuary_ on yourself with a duration of Recall. During an encounter, if a creature succeeds on its WIS check, it is temporarily immune to this effect for the rest of the encounter.

## Deflect Missiles (Reaction)

You deflect or catch the piece of ammunition or missile when a ranged weapon attack hits you, and the damage you take from the attack is reduced by LEVEL + 1. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less, you can catch the missile if it is small enough to hold in one hand and if you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend one use of your Ki feature to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 4 squares and a long range of 12 squares.

# Paladin

## Class Features

As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

- Chain mail and a holy symbol

## Divine Sense (Action, Cooldown CHA + 1)

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. You open your awareness and detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any aberration or undead within 12 squares of you that is not behind total cover, but you do not know its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the _hallow_ spell.

## Lay on Hands (Action)

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a reserve of healing power. You can assign up to 5 points of healing with your reserve.

You touch a wounded creature, spending 1 or more healing points up to the maximum remaining in your reserve. The creature receives the healing.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 points from your reserve to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

|3⛁|-|-|Sacred Oath|...|

## Fighting Style

You adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Armored

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Defense.

### Invoker

You learn two cantrips from the cleric spell list.

### Great Weapon Fighting

Whenever you attack and miss with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you may reroll the attack once and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection (Reaction)

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 1 square of you, you can discard your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

## Spellcasting

You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. You can cast 1st-level spells.

### Mana

You begin a game session with 2 mana. To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _cure wounds_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _cure wounds_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know CHA (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the paladin spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the paladin spells you know and replace it with another spell from the paladin spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your CHA whenever a paladin spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use CHA when setting the DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

## Divine Smite

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend up to LEVEL mana to deal an equal amount of radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.

## Sacred Oath

You swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.

### Oath Spells

Each oath has associated spells. You begin knowing two oath spells, and they do not count against the number of spells you know.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

### Channel Divinity (Rest)

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

# Sacred Oaths

Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. This final oath is taken at the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached this step and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.

## Oath of Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

### Tenets of Devotion

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

- **Honesty.** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.
- **Courage.** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
- **Compassion.** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those threatening them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.
- **Honor.** Treat others fairly, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.
- **Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

### Oath Spells

- protection from evil and good
- sanctuary

### Channel Divinity (Rest)

When you take this oath, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options.

**_Sacred Weapon_ (Action).** You imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For the rest of the encounter, you add CHA to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 4-square radius. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**_Turn the Abhorrent_ (Action).** You present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring aberrations and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each aberration or undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you must make a WIS check. If the creature fails its check, it is turned until the end of the encounter or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

# Ranger

## Class Features

As a ranger, you gain the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

## Favored Enemy

You have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two species of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on WIS checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on INT checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also gain the ability to understand the speech of your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

## Favored Terrain

Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. You are particularly familiar with the chosen type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. While your subtelty feature is toggled on, you ignore its movement restrictions if you start your turn on your favored terrain.

While traveling in your favored terrain and while you are the group token controller, you gain the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
- Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
- Your group always acts on the surprise round.
- Your group may move stealthily at a normal pace.
- You find one additional resource when you gather resources.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number and sizes and how long ago they passed through the area.

Game features with the Favored Terrain keyword can only be used while you are in your favored terrain.

## Natural Explorer (Favored Terrain, Rest 2)

You make an ability check related to your favored terrain, adding your level to the check twice instead of once. For example, making a STR check to climb a cliff or rocky slope is a related ability check for the mountain favored terrain.

## Subtlety (Toggle)

_Prerequisites: damage group role_

You must have cover or be out of LOS from any hostile creatures to activate this feature. While subtlety is activated, your movements and actions become obscured, cloaked from view, and easily overlooked. If a hostile minion or elite targets you while another target is within LOS, it must choose a different target, if possible. Your speed is reduced to half (minimum 2) while this feature is activated. You then take one action. If you take the Attack action or Cast a Spell action that includes a spell attack, you make your first attack with advantage, and then toggle this feature off.

If a game feature has the subtlety keyword, you can affect it using deception, sleight of hand, or stealth. If you use this feature this way, you make a CHA check for deception or a DEX check for sleight of hand or stealth. A success counts as two successes, and a critical success satisfies all requirements to resolve the conflict.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _cure wounds_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _cure wounds_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know WIS (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the ranger spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your WIS whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your WIS when setting the DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

## Ranger Archetype

You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter.

### Hunter

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

You gain one of the following features of your choice:

- **_Colossus Slayer_ (Action).** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. You take the Attack action. If you hit a creature not at MAX Wounds with a weapon attack, the creature takes +1 damage.
- **_Giant Killer_ (Reaction).** When a Large or larger creature within 1 square of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
- **_Horde Breaker_.** When you take the Attack action, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 1 square of the original target and within range of your weapon.

## Primeval Awareness (Action, Encounter)

Being a ranger means you are mystically connected to the land and to those who dwell upon it. You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it not to attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature you attacked during the encounter.

# Rogue

## Class Features

As a rogue, you have the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies

**Abilities:** Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT)

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords

- (a) a shortbow and quiver of arrows or (b) a shortsword
- (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s pack
- (a) Leather armor and a dagger

## Expertise

When you purchase this upgrade, you gain proficiency with a non-proficient ability. Then choose one of your ability proficiencies or Thieves' Tools. You add your level to ability checks with the chosen ability or feature twice instead of once. You cannot add your level more than twice with the chosen ability or feature.

## Sneak Attack (Turn)

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. You deal +1 damage to a creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 1 square of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Subtlety (Toggle)

_Prerequisites: damage group role_

You must have cover or be out of LOS from any hostile creatures to activate this feature. While subtlety is activated, your movements and actions become obscured, cloaked from view, and easily overlooked. If a hostile minion or elite targets you while another target is within LOS, it must choose a different target, if possible. Your speed is reduced to half (minimum 2) while this feature is activated. You then take one action. If you take the Attack action or Cast a Spell action that includes a spell attack, you make your first attack with advantage, and then toggle this feature off.

If a game feature has the subtlety keyword, you can affect it using deception, sleight of hand, or stealth. If you use this feature this way, you make a CHA check for deception or a DEX check for sleight of hand or stealth. A success counts as two successes, and a critical success satisfies all requirements to resolve the conflict.

## Thieves' Tools (Action, Turn)

While your subtlety feature is toggled on, you can make a DEX check to disarm a trap, pick a lock, or otherwise open a secured and locked object within reach. A critical failure toggles your subtlety feature off.

## Thieves’ Cant

During your rogue training, you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

# Rogue Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|2⛁|-|Cunning Action|...|
|3⛁|-|Roguish Archetype|...|

## Cunning Action (Action)

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You may take one action. You can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action before or after taking your action.

## Roguish Archetype

You choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief.

# Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, solving ciphers, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

## Fast Hands

You can use your Cunning Action to make a DEX check related to sleight of hand, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

## Second-Story Work

You gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by +1 square.

# Sorcerer

## Class Features

As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

### Equipment

- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
- Daggers

## Spellcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

### Cantrips

You know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

### Mana 2

To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _burning hands_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _burning hands_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know CHA (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the sorcerer spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

## Sorcerous Origin

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, such as Draconic Bloodline. Your choice grants you additional features.

## Draconic Bloodline

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

### Dragon Ancestor

Choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, you gain advantage on CHA checks while interacting with dragons.

**Draconic	Ancestry**
| Dragon | Damage	Type |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through your body, it causes the physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your MAX wounds increases by +1. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. As long as you have no armor equipped, you reduce damage assigned to you by minions by 1.

# Sorcerer Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Mana|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|3⛁|-|-|Sorcery|...|
|3⛁|-|4|Magic|You learn one spell from the sorcerer spell list.|
|3⛁|-|-|Metamagic|...|

## Sorcery (Cooldown 2 + LEVEL)

You tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself allowing you to create a variety of magical effects.

### Flexible Casting (Action, Turn)

You can spend a use of your sorcery feature to gain additional mana, or sacrifice mana to replenish an expended use of your sorcery feature.

You either spend two uses of your sorcery feature to gain 2 mana or expend 2 mana to refresh one use of your sorcery feature. You may then take one additional action.

## Metamagic

You gain the ability to change your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.

Unless otherwise noted, you can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it.

### Careful Spell

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make an ability check, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend one use of your sorcery feature and choose a number of those creatures up to your CHA (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its ability check against the spell.

### Distant Spell

When you cast a spell that has a range of 1 square or greater, you can spend one use of your sorcery feature to double the range of the spell.
When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend one use of your sorcery feature to make the range of the spell 6 squares.

### Empowered Spell

When a spell deals damage, you can spend two uses of your sorcery feature to increase the spell damage by +1.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used your sorcery feature this turn.

### Extended Spell

When you cast a spell that has a duration of encounter, you can spend one use of your sorcery feature to extend its duration to Recall.

### Heightened Spell

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make an ability check to resist its effects, you can spend three uses of your sorcery feature to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first ability check made against the spell.

### Quickened Spell (Turn)

You take the Cast a Spell action, casting a spell with a casting time of 1 action, spending two uses of your sorcery feature to change the spell's casting time to instant. If you repeat the Cast a Spell action during the same turn, the spell must be a cantrip.

### Subtle Spell

When you cast a spell, you can spend one use of your sorcery feature to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of uses of your sorcery feature equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (spend one use of your sorcery feature if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, _magic missile_ and _scorching ray_ aren’t eligible, but _ray of frost_ is.

# Warlock

## Class Features

As a warlock, you gain the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies

**Abilities:** Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA)

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment:

- (a) a light crossbow and bolts or (b) any simple weapon

- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

## Otherworldly Patron

You are in the service of an otherworldly being of your choice: the Fey, the Exile, or the Primordial, each detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you additional game features.

## Pact Magic (Rest)

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your otherworldly patron have given you facility with spells.

You can use this feature to cast a spell you know with a spell level up to LEVEL.

For example, if you are a 2nd-level warlock and know the 1st-level spell _rebuke_, you can use this feature to cast _rebuke_ as a 1st-level or 2nd-level spell.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.

### Spells Known

You know CHA (minimum 1) 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list that you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

## Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and abilities and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

## The Primordial

You have made a pact with a powerful elemental from within the Primordial Chaos, the home plane of existence for all elementals. Your primordial patron is strictly neutral in outlook and temperament, swayed only by their attunement to a specific elemental quality. Earth tends to be steady, tenacious, and indomitable. Water tends to be flexible and aware. Fire tends to be activating, charged, and focused. Air tends to be expansive and mobile. Primordials rarely involve themselves in mortal affairs or circumstances unless the elemental balance is threatened somehow. Such beings desire the propagation of the elements and their elemental outlook upon the prime material plane through you, their chosen vessel. Primordials powerful enough to forge a pact and their preferred elemental outlook include Phoneix (fire), Leviathan (water), Zaratan (earth), and Elder Tempest (air).

### Expanded Spell List

The Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

|Spell Level|Spells|
|:-:|:-:|
|1st|Burning Hands, Thunderwave|
|2nd|Acid Arrow, Flaming Sphere|
|3rd|Fireball, Lightning Bolt|
|4th|Conjure Minor Elementals, Wall of Fire|
|5th|Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold|
|6th|Chain Lightning, Freezing Sphere|
|7th|Delayed Blast Fireball, Prismatic Spray|
||
|Paragon|Control Weather, Incendiary Cloud|
|Epic|Gate, Prismatic Wall|

### Elemental Attunement

Your patron bestows you the ability to adapt elemental energies within the spells you cast from the Primordial expanded spell list. Whenever you cast a spell from the Primordial expanded spell list that deals elemental damage (fire, cold, acid, or lighting) damage, you may choose to replace the damage type with the type preferred by your patron (Phoenix: fire, Laviathon: cold, Zaraton: acid, and Elder Tempest: lightning). Spells you cast ignore damage resistance to your patron's preferred damage type.

Spells modified by this feature lose secondary effects unrelated to elemental damage. For example, a cold _fireball_ no longer ignites combustibles within the spell's area of effect. Similarly, an acid _thunderwave_ does not push creatures or unsecured objects and no longer generates a thunderous boom. A lightning _acid arrow_, however, still deals additional lightning damage at the end of the creature's next turn.

# Warlock Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|2⛁|-|Eldritch Invocations|...|
|3⛁|-|Magic|You gain Pact Magic (Rest 2). Add +1 known spell from the warlock spell list.|
|3⛁|-|Pact Boon|...|

## Eldritch Invocations

In your study of esoteric lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of arcane knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed below.

Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

If an eldritch invocation grants innate spellcasting, the spell uses your spell DC and spell attack modifier.

### Performance Blast

_Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip_

Your _eldritch blast_ spells deal +1 damage.

### Eldritch Armor (Action)

You can innately cast _mage armor_ on yourself at will.

### Beast Speech (Action)

You can innately cast _speak with animals_ at will.

### Beguiling Influence (Action, Cooldown)

You can innately cast _charm person_ without verbal or somatic components.

### Book of Ancient Secrets

_Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature_

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Tome of Secrets. Choose two 1st-­level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Tome of Secrets in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

You can add other ritual spells to your Tome of Secrets on your adventures. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your level and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. The transcription process takes one downtime round and costs ⛁ for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

### Eldritch Sight

You see normally in magical darkness, and you can read all writing.

### Eldritch Vigor

At the beginning of an encounter, you gain bolster 1.

### Gaze of Two Minds (Action)

You touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can discard your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Mask of Many Faces

You can inately cast _disguise self_ at will.

### Misty Visions

You can inately cast _silent image_ at will.

### Repelling Blast

_Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip_

When you hit a creature with _eldritch blast_, you can push the creature up to 2 squares away from you in a straight line.

### Thief of Five Fates (Cooldown)

You cast _bane_ using your pact magic feature.

### Voice of the Chain Master

_Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature_

You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.

## Pact Boon

Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

### Pact of the Chain

You learn the _find familiar_ spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: homunculus, pseudodragon, tiny elemental, or sprite.

### Pact of the Blade (Action)

You create a melee pact weapon lacking the two-handed property in your empty hand. You can choose the form this weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. The weapon's damage type depends on the weapon's form: blades are piercing or slashing, and chains, hammers, and clubs are bludgeoning. You may use CHA instead of DEX or STR to make attack rolls with a pact weapon.

Your pact weapon disappears at the end of your turn if it is more than 1 square away from you. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of a rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases to be your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the pact of the blade ritual on a different weapon, or if you use the ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Pact of the Tome

Your patron gives you a Tome of Secrets containing eldritch mysteries and insights. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nevertheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Tome of Secrets, you can perform a ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

# Wizard

## Class Features

As a wizard, you gain the following class features.

### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

### Proficiencies

**Abilities:** Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS)

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment:

- (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
- A spellbook

## Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### Mana 2

To cast one of your spells, you must spend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _magic missile_ and have 2 mana, you can spend 1 mana to cast _magic missile_ as a 1st-level spell or 2 mana to cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known

You know 2 + INT (minimum 1) 1st-level spells from the wizard spell list.

Whenever you purchase a Magic upgrade, you can choose one spell of your choice from the wizard spell list that you can cast and add it to your spellbook for free. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your INT whenever a wizard spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use INT when setting the DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + INT

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + INT

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

### Spellbook

You have a spellbook containing your known wizard spells. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Except for cantrips, your wizard spells require you to have your spellbook in your equipment or in hand.

## Arcane Recovery (Cooldown)

Studying your spellbook taught you how to replenish some of your magical energy. You gain LEVEL mana when you finish a rest.

## Your Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own and the intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. For example, you could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
 
***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook during a downtime round by spending ⛁ for each level of the spell beyond 1st, but only if it is a spell you can learn. For example, a 3rd-level wizard can add the 3rd-level spell _stoneskin_ by spending 2⛁. During another downtime round, it can also add the 1st-level spell _magic missile_ without spending additional Coin.
 
Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell and then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your notation.

The cost associated with copying spells into your spellbook reflects the material components you use while experimenting with the spell to master it, along with the special inks necessary for recording it. After completing the necessary downtime, you know the spell.

***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier since you understand your notation and already know how to cast the spell. You can create a copy of your spellbook or update it with any new spells you have discovered during downtime round.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

***The Book’s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

# Wizard Upgrades

|Cost|Prerequisites|Mana|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
|2⛁|-|-|Arcane Tradition|...|
|3⛁|-|4|Magic|You learn one spell from the wizard spell list.|

## Arcane Tradition

You choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

### Evocation

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. You gain the following game features.

**_Evocation Savant_.** The Coin required to add evocation spells to your spellbook is halved.

**_Sculpt Spells_.** You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their ability checks against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful check.

# Beyond 1st Level

As you go on adventures and overcome challenges, you gain experience, represented by Coin. When all world map tiles in the current level of play are explored, the next level of play on the world map unlocks, and you advance to the next level. This is called gaining a level.

> Whenever your level increases, you also increase your MAX wounds by +1.
> 
> Whenever your CON changes, recalculate your MAX wounds with the new CON score.

Once you reach level 4, the game state changes. You gain a level once all areas in the current level of play are explored and resolved. Level 4 areas are located one floor above or below level 1 footholds and in the unresolved footholds found in level 1 world map tiles. Similarly, level 5 areas are located one floor above or below level 2 footholds and in the unresolved footholds found in level 2 world map tiles. Level 6 areas are located one floor above or below level 3 footholds and in the unresolved footholds found in level 3 world map tiles. Level 7 areas are located two floors above or below level 1 footholds.

While at HQ, you can spend Coin to purchase species, class, or other upgrades for your character. You can only purchase an upgrade once unless otherwise indicated in its description. An upgrade detail with three dots means its details are provided in the feature's description. If an upgrade grants a game feature your character already has, the upgraded version replaces it. Your setting handbook may provide additional upgrades.

The following properties describe most upgrades.

### Cost

The number of Coin you spend to purchase an upgrade.

### Prerequisites

You must satisfy this upgrade prerequisite before purchasing it. You can satisfy a prerequisite at the same time that you purchase an upgrade.

### Feature

The name of the game feature. If you already have the game feature, replace it with the upgraded version.

### Mana

If an upgrade includes a mana score, replace your mana score with this number.

### Details

Some upgrades provide a simple description. More complicated upgrades have a "..." listing. This means the upgrade details are explained in its description.

## Inspiration Upgrades

The following upgrades provide additional ways to gain inspiration. Your setting handbook may give you additional upgrades.

|Cost|Feature|Details|
|-:|:-|:-|
|3⛁|Inspired Success (Cooldown)|You gain inspiration after resolving a critical success.|
|3⛁|Inspired Failure (Cooldown)|You gain inspiration after resolving a critical failure.|
|3⛁|Inspired Support (Cooldown)|...|

### Inspired Support (Cooldown)

If a game feature helps you succeed when you would have otherwise failed, you gain inspiration at the end of your turn.

# Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Player characters must select a non-evil alignment at character creation. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

> ### Playable Alignments
>> **GOOD.** Favors the common good for all. Fairness and consideration of others.
>> 
>> **LAWFUL.** Best able to turn chaos into a degree of order with purpose.
>> 
>> **CHAOTIC.** Best able to grow and adapt to changes.
>> 
>> **NEUTRAL.** Undecided. Understands that there is a time and place for each alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Pseudodragons, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Efreeti, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Gargoyles, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid species can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-­aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other species, though, made those species to serve them. Those species have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even those with a distant orc ancestor feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)

Alignment is sometimes an essential part of the nature of some creatures. An efreeti does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be an efreeti.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

## Languages

All PCs know the common language. Other game features may grant you the ability to understand the speech of monsters or other characters.

# Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the GM uses to reward you when you show up to play a game session on time and for playing your character in an exceptional way.

## Gaining Inspiration

At the beginning of each game session, PCs choose two different dedications from Insight, Medicine, Perception, Performance, or Survival (see _Dedications_ below). Once the choices are made, the chosen dedications can only be changed at the beginning of the next game session. Your GM then awards inspiration to all PCs who are physically or virtually (for online games) present. A player is present if they are in the room. Remote players who are away from their keyboards do not receive inspiration. Your GM also has the option to grant you inspiration for various reasons during gameplay. Generally, inspiration is given when you effectively portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM may introduce other ways to earn inspiration during the game. Your setting handbook may also introduce other ways to earn inspiration during the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can spend it when you roll to attack, resist a game feature, or otherwise perform an action. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll, allowing you to roll twice and keep the better result. Alternatively, you may spend your inspiration anytime to activate a dedication you made at the start of the game session.

Whenever you spend your inspiration, you can choose to activate a dedication you did not choose at the start of the current game session as a cooldown.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Dedications

The following describes each dedication and how to use them in the game.

### Insight

Your insight imbues inward sight, granting vision beneath surface impressions.

Your GM reveals all the relevant hidden or obscured pieces of information in the current scene. Features granted through spell effects specifically designed to prevent sight, such as _invisibility_ or an equivalent effect, are not revealed; instead, their presence is confirmed, and you can sense the subtle flows of energy the spell displaces in its wake. This awareness lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

### Medicine

Your medicine stabilizes wounds.

Choose any number of creatures your character can see within 6 squares of you who are at MAX Wounds. The chosen creatures receive 1 point of healing.

> #### Other Game Systems
> Choose any number of creatures your character can see within 6 squares of you who are unconscious and dying. The selected creatures receive sufficient healing to stabilize their wounds, regain minimal health, and awaken, allowing them to take action on their next turn.
>
> 5eFP is forgiving around character death because the point of 5eFP is not to kill off all the PCs as fast as possible. Instead, it encourages _ongoing gameplay with familiar characters to engender a felt experience over time_. If your game has no grace period wherein PCs may recover from a deadly blow, then allow an inspired medicine to bring them back, but at the edge of death (one more hit will take them out again).

### Perception

Your perception enables you to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.

Your GM reveals all relevant information regarding the current scene gathered through the five senses (sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch).

### Performance

Your performance allows the satisfying completion of one action.

You decide the outcome of the next action your character declares on their turn. You must use your inspiration this way before taking an action or rolling any dice.

If the result of your chosen action further affects you on subsequent rounds during the same encounter, make all related die rolls with advantage.

> Your decision can only affect the outcome of that single action. If desired, you can add colorful descriptions of the action, particularly for critical hit damage. But your narrative can only affect that single action.
>
> For example, suppose you are in a combat encounter with goblins in a goblin lair. If you are deciding the outcome of an attack action against a goblin, your choices include a successful or unsuccessful hit. If an attack is successful, you choose the attack damage from 1 point, normal, or critical hit damage (double damage). You can also choose whether or not the goblin is knocked out if it reaches MAX Wounds. You cannot, however, add anything that would contradict the encounter, such as, "and then a secret door opens up on the cavern wall, revealing an exit passage into an underground garden area."
>
> While the secret door, exit, and underground garden area are creative and fascinating, they were not preestablished story elements before you took your action and cannot be inserted into the narrative of that action.
>
> Spells, skills, and game feature results must stay within the guidelines established in their rules. If a spell targets a creature with a die roll, you decide whether it is successful or not. If successful, you decide on the damage (if any) and the effect must match what that spell, skill, or game feature is capable of doing at the current level of play. You cannot add narrative elements that add or take away more.

>> Example 1:
>>> (_GM_) "The room opens up, exposing a sprawling cliff face leading to the top of the spire."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "I spend my inspiration on PERFORMANCE."
>>> 
>>> (_GM_) "OK, great. Tell us about what action your character wants to take. And then, when you're ready, tell us what happens."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "Thanks. Lita leaps onto the cliff face, finds her grip, and makes her way to the top."
>>> 
>> In example 1, _Player 1_'s action resolves a successful STR check without rolling to begin climbing the cliff face to reach the top of the spire, 40 squares above Lita's position. _Player 1 has indicated that this climb is important in some way_. While climbing the cliff, Lita makes all attacks and ability checks with advantage. Later, during the cliff-face encounter, Lita's skill is tested again due to strong winds. Lita must succeed on a STR check to hold onto the cliff. Lita rolls STR with advantage because she is still in the same cliff-face encounter.
>>
>> _Player 1_ may influence or affect the cliff-face narrative of an encounter but cannot end it with the inspired performance because the top of the cliff is 40 squares above Lita. Lita's movement speed is 3 squares while climbing. Without an alternative form of transportation, she can't reach the top in one round.
>>
>> Example 2: 
>>> _(GM)_ "Ok, it's your turn."
>>> 
>>> _(Player 2)_ "I spend my inspiration on PERFORMANCE."
>>> 
>>> _(GM)_ "OK, great. Tell us about what action your character wants to take. And then, when you're ready, tell us what happens."
>>> 
>>> _(Player 2)_ "Dunsmuir jumps out of the shadows where he's hiding and attacks the goblin, catching it off guard and unaware. He strikes with a critical hit, dealing maximum damage to the creature, adding his sneak attack damage."
>>> 
>> In example 2, _Player 2_'s action resolves a successful attack action from a hidden position and then finishes. The action does not continue on subsequent rounds.

### Survival

Your survival awards expanded capacities, allowing you to identify and acquire new advantages, qualities, or skills.

When you use your dedication to activate Survival, choose one of the following:

- **_Reveal a game objective_.** Place a foothold or setting handbook requirement on a revealed square of your choice up to 2 squares away from you.
- **_Gain a resource (playtesting)_.** Choose and gain the benefits of one of your game features that is on cooldown.
- **_Gain a skill_ (Turn) (playtesting).** Choose an incomplete class or species upgrade available to you. You gain temporary access to its game features. You must still satisfy any prerequisites before choosing the upgrade.

> **Other Game Systems**
>
>> When you use your dedication to activate Survival, the GM indicates the direction and position (if within view) of your current focused objective on the map. For example, a player might activate Survival when faced with three mysterious doors. The GM reveals the door leading to the player's current quest. How your character knows this is connected with their class abilities, skills, and game features. Healers might receive divine inspiration to determine the result. Mages might use divination magic to determine the result. Scoundrels might use knowledge, cunning, or preternatural awareness to determine the result. Warriors might use knowledge, survival skills, or gut instincts to determine the result.

# Equipment

## Multi-Use Items

Certain items in the game can be used multiple times. Items with this game feature have the multi-use keyword. All multi-use items use the same rules.

If a multi-use item provides a bonus or effect to a creature, the bonus or effect persists until the beginning of that creature's next turn.

Multi-use items deplete over time. When a multi-use item depletes, rotate it clockwise 90 degrees or otherwise mark the item as depleted. If it is already depleted, the item only has one use left. Indicate this by turning the item upside down or otherwise marking it as one use left. If an item depletes with only one use left, you use the item as usual and then discard it at the end of your turn.

If the multi-use item is used to make an attack roll, it depletes whenever you roll a critical failure. If the multi-use item is not used to make an attack roll, it depletes after each use.

## Coin

5eFP games use Coin (⛁ equals 1 Coin), a single denomination representing wealth, resources, experience, and reputation. The name of a Coin may change in some games. For example, Coin might be called "gold pieces" in a medieval fantasy setting, while Coin might refer to "credits" in a futuristic sci-fi setting. A game's setting handbook describes the name used for Coin. Use the following rules for all Coin.

## Earning Coin

GMs award ⛁ whenever PCs complete an encounter. Award an additional ⛁ if the PCs found one or more treasures during the encounter. Award an additional ⛁ if the PCs increased one or more reputations during the encounter.

The number of Coin GMs award when encounters are completed increases to 2⛁ starting at 3rd level and 3⛁ beginning at 6th level.

### Spending Coin

PCs may spend Coin after Recall, during downtime (see Downtime), or during preparation (see Preparation) before deploying to a world map tile. Once Coin is spent, it is lost.

A game feature may temporarily grant PCs the ability to spend Coin. The feature explains when this happens and provides guidelines for how many Coin a PC can choose to spend.

## Selling Treasure
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the areas you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to HQ.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. This means you must sell two pieces of the same equipment in order to receive any Coin.  Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond what simple Coin represent and should always be treated as such.

PCs may choose to create a magic item marketplace by unlocking this building through downtime research.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items are included in the description of Coin. Coin does not differentiate between coinage, gems, jewelry, and art for ease of use and simplicity.

**Trade Goods.** On the borderlands (the world map tiles furthest from HQ), many people conduct transactions through barter. Trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency. You may spend 1 or more trade goods as if they were an equivalent amount of ⛁ within the level 3 and level 6 areas. Spent trade goods are discarded.

## Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

***Armor Proficiency.*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check or attack roll that involves STR or DEX, and you can’t cast spells.

**_Damage Reduction_.** Armor reduces damage dealt to its wearer from attacks. Medium and heavy armor also reduces the number of wounds assigned to the wearer. The armor (and shield) you wear determines how much damage reduction you get or if you can reduce the number of wounds assigned to you.

### Shield

A shield is made from wood or metal and requires a free hand to equip. While you have a shield equipped, you have the following game features.

- **_Shield Bash_.** Whenever you take the Attack action and use one of your attacks to shove a creature, if you succeed, you can deal 1 point of bludgeoning damage to the creature.
- **_Shield (Reaction, Rest)_.** When damage is dealt to you while you have a shield equipped, you may reduce that damage by 1.

### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility, reducing any assigned minion damage dealt to you by 1.

***Padded.*** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

***Leather.*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. Some leather may also be studded or reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but impairs movement more. Medium armor reduces any damage dealt to you by 1 and grants bolster 1 at the start of an encounter, but the wearer has disadvantage on DEX checks related to moving silently. Your Defense while wearing medium armor equals 10 + DEX (maximum +2).

***Breastplate.*** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

***Chain Mail.*** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

### Heavy Armor

Heavy armor decreases damage taken by LEVEL, but hinders movement, reducing your speed by 2 squares unless your STR is +2 or higher. Additionally, the wearer has disadvantage on DEX checks related to moving silently.

***Plate.*** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

You gain the following game features while wearing heavy armor.

- **_Heavy Armor (Rest)_.** Whenever an attack critically hits you while wearing heavy armor, you can use this feature to treat it as a regular hit.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

You may don or doff armor as part of completing a rest.

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within your reach, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

### Weapon Proficiency

Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to the best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your LEVEL to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your LEVEL to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**_Ammunition_ (Multi-Use).** You can use a weapon with the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon in your equipment. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-­handed weapon).

Ammunition may be used to make melee attacks. If you are proficient with the weapon that uses the ammunition, you are proficient with melee attacks using that weapon's ammunition as well. Ammunition deals 1 point of damage with the same damage type as the weapon that uses the ammunition. If you use a weapon with the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

**_Light._** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for fighting with two weapons.

**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**_Multi-Use._** Drawing the multi-use weapon from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists the weapon’s normal range in squares. You may make a ranged attack beyond the weapon's normal range, but doing so imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds +1 square to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon.

**_Two-­Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes, characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

An improvised weapon deals 1 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object) and can be thrown up to 4 squares.

#### Silvered Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest a little extra to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ammunition at a forge for 6⛁. You may spend trade goods silver (ore or bar) to reduce this cost to 3⛁. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

#### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**_Lance._** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 1 square of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

**_Net._** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 STR check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 1 slashing damage to the net (DC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Acid._** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

**_Alchemist’s Fire._** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on ability checks against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 DEX check or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the DEX check.

Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).

Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX check or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make DEX check.

Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold
up to twenty crossbow bolts.

Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case
can hold up to ten rolled-­‐‑up sheets of paper or five rolled-­‐‑up sheets of parchment.

Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).

Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.

Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.

Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a WIS check.

Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-­‐‑B "Fantasy-­‐‑Historical Pantheons" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse.

Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.

A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-­level spell slot.

Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-­toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 DEX check or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 STR check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 3-square radius and dim light for an additional 6 squares. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-­‐‑foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius.

Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 CON check or take an additional 1 point of poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for the rest of the encounter before drying.

Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).

Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.

Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-­‐‑bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.

Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

# Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class upgrades give you the Ability Score Improvement feature. You can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise and you can only gain one feat per level.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Otherworldly Invocation feat requires you to have the spellcasting or pact magic feature. If your spellcasting or pact magic feature is suppressed or removed—perhaps by a dead magic zone—you can’t benefit from the Otherworldly Invocation feat until your the prerequisite is restored.

Some feats can be upgraded. If the option to upgrade is available, the upgrades are listed at the end of the feat's description.

# Using Ability Scores

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength (STR)**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity (DEX)**, measuring agility
- **Constitution (CON)**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence (INT)**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom (WIS)**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma (CHA)**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-­bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.

The two main rolls of the game—the ability check and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of +0 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of +4 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as +5, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as +10.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus, which is equal to their LEVEL. Monsters may also have this bonus. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus is typically added to a single die roll or other number once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a WIS check, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the check.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be added one additional time (to a maximum of twice). For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature allows you to add your proficiency bonus twice for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than twice to the same roll, you still add it only twice.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to add an additional proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check, you do not have a proficiency bonus. Only ability checks you are proficient with gain an additional proficiency bonus. For instance, if you lack proficiency with CON, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you add an additional proficiency bonus when you make CON ability checks.

In general, you don’t add an additional proficiency bonus for attack rolls or ability checks. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

**Typical Difficult Classes**
|Task Difficulty|DC|
|:-|:-|
|Very easy|5|
|Easy|10|
|Medium|15|
|Hard|20|
|Very hard|25|
|Nearly impossible|30|

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

### Contests

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, Monrovia is a 1st-­level character with WIS +2. Thus Monrovia's passive WIS score is 13 (10 + 2 [WIS] + 1 [LEVEL]).

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.

### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group WIS check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game. (A character’s starting proficiencies are determined by class at character creation, and a monster’s ability proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)

## Strength (STR)

STR measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

### STR Checks

A STR check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

The GM might call for a STR check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff
- Avoid hazards while scaling a wall
- Cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump
- Swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-­tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed
- Another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming
- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

### Attack Rolls

If you chose STR for your attack rolls at character creation, you add your STR to your attack roll when attacking with a weapon.

### Lifting and Carrying

Your STR score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

_**Carrying Capacity.**_ Your carrying capacity is 3 + STR (minimum 1). This is how much equipment you can carry in addition to any equipped items.

_**Push, Drag, or Lift.**_ You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds equal to 30 x STR. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of this number, your speed drops to 1 square.

_**Size and Strength.**_ Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these values.

## Dexterity (DEX)

DEX measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

### DEX Checks

A DEX check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.

The GM might call for a DEX check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Stay on your feet in a tricky situation
- Acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips
- Legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person
- Lift a coin purse off another person or slip something into or out of another person’s pocket
- Conceal yourself from others
- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
- Steer a chariot around a tight turn
- Pick a lock
- Disable a trap
- Securely tie up a prisoner
- Wriggle free of bonds
- Play a stringed instrument
- Craft a small or detailed object

### Attack Rolls

If you chose DEX for your attack rolls at character creation, you add your DEX to your attack roll when attacking with a weapon.

### Defense

Defense can prevent attacks from hitting you and equals 10 + DEX. Upgrades and class features may further modify this number.

> Hiding
>
> The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a DEX check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the WIS check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
> You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
>
> An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
>
> _**Passive WIS.**_ When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your DEX check with that creature’s passive WIS score, which equals 10 + the creature’s WIS score, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 proficiency, he or she has a passive WIS of 13.
>
> _**What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in "The Environment.”

### Constitution (CON)

CON measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### CON Checks

A CON check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### MAX Wounds

Your total MAX Wounds equals CON + MAX Wounds provided by your class.

If your CON modifier changes, calculate your new MAX Wounds total as though you had the new modifier. If your MAX Wounds reduces below the number of wounds you have, you fall unconscious and discard any excess wounds. Discarding any number of wounds in this way causes one automatic death save failure.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### INT Checks

An INT check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning.

The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes
- Recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations
- Recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles
- Recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults
- Look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues
- Communicate with a creature without using words
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Forge a document
- Recall lore about a craft or trade
- Win a game of skill

#### Initiative

At the beginning of every encounter, you roll initiative by rolling d20 + INT. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wizards use INT as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom (WIS)

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### WIS Checks

A WIS check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person.

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions
- Determine the true intentions of a creature
- Stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness
- Spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something
- Follow tracks
- Hunt wild game
- Guide your group through frozen wastelands
- Identify signs that owlbears live nearby
- Predict the weather
- Avoid quicksand and other natural hazards
- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use WIS as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

### Charisma (CHA)

CHA measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### CHA Checks

A CHA check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation.

The GM might call for a CHA check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Convincingly hide the truth
- Influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence
- Delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment
- Influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature
- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
- Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use CHA as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

## Resisting Spells and Game Features

Resisting a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat requires a successful ability check. You don’t normally decide to make these ability checks; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

The DC for a game feature is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the ability check DC for a spell is determined by the caster’s spell DC.

The result of a successful or failed ability check is also detailed in the effect that allows the ability check. Usually, a successful ability check means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

A character or monster can choose not to resist a spell or game feature.

# Time

5eFP simplifies time by adding a countdown clock with eight segments. At the start of the game session, the marker is set at the top or highest value. Starting an encounter, taking a rest, or using a special game rule or feature causes the countdown marker to decrease by 1 step (lower the number by - 1). When the countdown clock reaches 0, the PCs recall after the encounter or rest ends.

In combat and other fast-­paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-­second span of time.

# Movement

TBA

# The Environment

TBA

## Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Magical darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

> 5eFP games obscure unexplored areas of a map with obscuring tiles. This fog-of-war effect is removed as PCs explore map tiles. Unless otherwise indicated, all revealed map tiles are lit by bright light. So, there is no dim light condition, and 5eFP games do not use darkvision rules nor cantrips whose sole purpose is to shed light, such as _light_ or _dancing lights_. This is a deliberate design feature to simplify combat on a grid.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as magical darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix [...]) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates two categories of illumination: bright light and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness in an area of magical darkness.

### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on ability checks against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Food and Water

Obtaining food and water is included when PCs spend Coin on rest and repairs. Characters who do not spend Coin on rest and repairs suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix [...]) during the next game session. Exhaustion caused by not resting and repairing can’t be removed until the character spends Coin on rest and repairs.

> (This section needs to be moved to Rest and Repairs section.)

## Interacting with Objects

TBA

# Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can rest in the midst of an adventuring day.

## Rest

A rest is at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

PCs may discard up to LEVEL wounds at the end of a rest.

# Downtime

Downtime consists of downtime actions measured in rounds, including rest and repairs, research, spending Coin on HQ upgrades, or taking other actions between game sessions. The first downtime round begins after all PCs Recall and finish spending Coin on character upgrades. If you spend ⛁ on rest and repairs during downtime, you gain an extended rest of at least 8 hours for sleeping or light activities. Once completed, your gear is repaired, you replenish any depleted ammunition or multi-use items, and you discard any wounds. If you do not spend ⛁ on rest and repairs during downtime, you do not gain the benefits of an extended rest and instead gain one level of exhaustion.

> Downtime in RL can be ignored, but it will likely disrupt or even end your health and wellness! Working, which includes working on your inner life, needs moderation and temperance. There is a time to work, a time to play, and a time to do nothing at all. Doing nothing, which is also known as resting with minimal effort, allows for the most effective Medicine. Without Medicine or first aid and other medical interventions, your wounds continue to bleed out. Gross downtime negligence indicates a passive and lengthy suicide, for a death like this is preventable with a degree of self-care.
> 
> The actions you take in RL happen between game sessions. Try to harmonize what your PC does during downtime rounds with what you are working on in RL.

Your first downtime round is free. You can only gain one benefit per downtime round. For example, you could spend ⛁ on rest and repairs during a downtime round or move your token onto an HQ location that provides a different benefit, but you cannot do both. You can purchase more rounds of downtime by spending ⛁ for each additional round.

If your character Recalls dead, HQ healers cast _gentle repose_ on or take steps to preserve your character's remains, transporting them to a holding room within the crypt or morgue. In this room, players decide what to do next with the deceased character. The player whose character died can choose whether to retire the character or take other actions.

When a character retires, healers conduct a funeral service, and the character will be added to the crypt. The player can continue playing the sidekick or create a new character. They may also spend a downtime round reviving the deceased character if they can afford the revival cost, which all players can contribute to.

Dead characters cannot benefit from downtime rounds until they are revived or healed.

If your character Recalls stabilized at MAX Wounds, your character spends the first downtime round discarding one wound, which revives the PC. Once revived, the PC may then purchase additional rounds of downtime.

Once downtime finishes, GMs and players spend 5 minutes on unstructured downtime for self-reflection. During this downtime, activities can include resting, taking a break, journaling, drawing, or reflecting on the game session experience. Following this period of self-reflection, there is a 25-minute group-sharing session facilitated by the GM and conducted using talking stick rules.

> When a player wishes to speak, they pick up the talking stick. If the talking stick is unavailable because someone else is using it, the player must wait until it is available. The player holding the talking stick has the floor and may speak without others speaking, interrupting, or crosstalking. Once a player has finished sharing, they can pass the talking stick to the next player who wants to contribute or place it in the center of the sharing space. Players are encouraged to be mindful of one another and allow as many fellow players a chance to speak as possible.
> 
> GMs facilitate the sharing, allowing all players to speak first. With permission, they may step into a player's sharing to help them understand 5eFP concepts and subtleties but otherwise remain silent and receptive witnesses. Questions about 5eFP mechanics and features are reserved after everyone has shared. GMs are encouraged to limit their sharing to a minimum and only share what it was like to run the game session. The game session is mainly an opportunity for players to share their experiences with peers (GMs are only peers with other GMs) and integrate what arises into their real lives. The current game session ends once the sharing is complete.

## Downtime Rounds

The PC with the most Coin acts first during a downtime round, followed by the PC with the second highest Coin total. All remaining PCs then take their downtime rounds in any order. The players yield to one another to resolve ties. Ties for the first to act place their character tokens simultaneously, yielding to one another. At the start of a PC's downtime round, they can place their character token on an available downtime location in HQ. At the end of the round, PCs gain any end-of-turn benefits associated with their chosen downtime location (see below). You indicate that your downtime actions are complete by saying, "pass." A downtime round ends once all players have passed.

While at HQ, the following downtime round options become available regardless of downtime location.

- Spend ⛁ or more on HQ upgrades.
- Spend ⛁ or more on HQ research.
- **Research.** Spend ⛁ and choose one from a creature, item, location, lore, or restricted or otherwise unavailable game feature. Add the chosen research to the list of available HQ research. By default, research requires 5⛁ to complete. Any player may contribute to the cost of completing research during their turn. Some research may require additional Coin to complete as indicated within its description. When creature research is completed, PCs can read that creature's stat block. Completing research on a restricted game feature upgrades the practice's gameplay, unlocking the feature and making it playable. For example, Gnome can be added as a playable species. When other forms of research are complete, the PCs decide what is learned, revealing one new piece of information about the nature of the research subject. If it is determined that more than one piece of information can be gained through research, the PCs must begin and complete new research for each additional piece of information.

### Level 1 HQ Upgrades

- Buildings (10⛁)

### HQ Research

TBA

### Expanded Downtime Locations

The following locations offer expanded downtime options but must first be unlocked through upgrades or research. Unless stated otherwise, a building becomes unlocked when PCs complete the Buildings HQ upgrade.

**Docks (unlock).** Gain access to the docks by discovering the world map tile containing the docks symbol and includes the following downtime options.
- Spend any number of ⛁ on HQ's docks research upgrades.
- You and up to 4 additional PCs spend ⛁ to gain passage onboard a ship at HQ's docks. PCs on a ship resolve their downtime together once they board and move the ship.

**Market.** TBA.

**Temple.** Include the following downtime options.
- Spend (1) herbs to get (1) healing potion.
- Spend ⛁ to cast *lesser restoration*.
- Spend 5⛁ to cast *greater restoration*.
- Spend 25⛁ to cast *raise dead* on a fallen ally.

**Manor.** TBA.

**Barracks.** TBA.

**Forge.** TBA.

**Refugee Camps.** TBA.

**Firing Range.** TBA.

**Monument.** TBA.

**Tower.** TBA.

**Enclave.** TBA.

**Mystic Jeweler.** TBA.

**Library.** TBA.

**Guild.** TBA.

## Downtime Actions

During a round of downtime, a PC can perform the following actions:

- **1 Action.** Choose and gain the benefit of one downtime activity.
- **1 Reaction.** You have one reaction during a round of downtime. Once you use your reaction, you cannot do so again until the beginning of the next downtime round.
- **2 Interact with an Object.** You may equip or unequip up to two items.

### Crafting

Choose this option to create items used in the game.

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to make it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every round of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one item. The cost of creating some items requires spending more than one downtime round.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have the relevant tools equipped and are working together in the same place. Each additional character contributes +1 downtime round toward crafting the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities contribute +3 downtime rounds toward crafting a suit of plate armor. Crafting plate armor requires six rounds of downtime to complete.

Whenever you choose the crafting downtime activity, you can choose to create any one of the following items, provided you meet the prerequisites:

**Healing Potion.** You create a minor healing potion.

- (a) herbalism kit equipped and (b) 1 trade goods (herb), or (a) healer class

**Holy Water.** You create holy water.

- healer class or
- temple building

**Trade Goods.** You harvest, gather, or forge trade goods. You may discard a trade good to gain an additional downtime round. Required:

- artisan guildhall building or
- (a) 1 trade good in your inventory and (b) the relevant tool is equipped

## Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

### Fast Travel

Once a destination square is chosen on the world map and the deployment action is taken, PCs deploy instantaneously.

> For Game Masters: Why is deployment Randomized?
>> 
>> Come up with a reason that fits the story. For example, in Enchanted Forest, PCs use mystic skipping stones to fast travel to unexplored world map tiles. The stones are imprecise in where they land. This is a good reason why it is randomized. Others include getting lost, uncertainty, strong currents, resistance, or interference.

### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in squares that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move ~~in a minute, an hour, or a day~~.

#### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds are generally performed on relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-­filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-­covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 square in difficult terrain costs 2 squares of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance.

### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each square of movement costs 1 extra square (2 extra squares in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful STR check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful STR check.

When swimming, you only provoke opportunity attacks from creatures with a reach score of 2 or more squares if you have swim speed.

#### Flying

While flying, you only trigger opportunity attacks from creatures with a reach score of 2 or more squares and fall prone when unconscious. Flight can be granted without also granting a fly speed, such as with the _fly_ spell or with certain game rules, features, or equipment. A fly speed grants the hover special ability. If you can hover, you do not fall prone when unconscious.

#### Jumping

Your STR determines how far you can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of squares up to STR if you move at least 2 squares on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs one square of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a STR check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a 1-square cube), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DEX check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of squares equal to STR if you move at least 2 squares on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs a square of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a STR check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms into adjacent squares up to your reach during the jump.

# Forming a Group

Unlike traditional tabletop roleplaying games, 5eFP has no set group or time to play. The GM posts available days and times for game sessions according to their schedule. Players then choose the best day and time based on GM availability. The player who initiates forming a group becomes the group leader. An adventuring group consists of at least three and at most five PCs. The party leader notifies the GM and schedules a game session after at least three players agree on a specific day and time.

All PCs in a group choose a group role before selecting a destination and deploying onto a map. Group leaders may pick their role first when forming a party.

### Group Roles

When PCs form a group, they choose one of three beneficial status effects that activate while deployed on a map. Group leaders may choose their group role first. A group can have a maximum of one defender, one healer, and up to three damage roles. The defender and healer roles are chosen first, followed by damage roles.

### Defender

Players with the defender role typically strive to draw the focus of adversaries while safeguarding the more vulnerable player characters in the group from harm. The following features take effect during an encounter before initiative order is determined.

- You gain _Bolster 1_. You may combine this bolster with another bolster effect.
- At the end of each of your turns, all minions, elites, and bosses that can see you gain the taunted condition if you are not unconscious or incapacitated and are the closest adversary within their LOS.
- You take your turn immediately. You pass your turn on round 1.

### Healer

Players with the healer role typically use effects and game features to heal, protect, and empower allies. They also provide primary support for defenders.

- On your turn, the first time you target a creature or game feature with an attack, spell, or effect, resolve that action. Afterward, you may choose a different creature, minion, elite, or boss within 1 square of the target to receive 1 point of healing, granting it an additional ability check to resist up to one ongoing negative effect. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Damage

Players with the damage role typically use effects and game features to deal damage and hinder adversaries.

- On your turn, the first time you successfully target a creature or game feature with an attack, spell, or effect, resolve that action. Afterward, you may choose a different minion, elite, or boss within 1 square of the target to take 1 point of damage of the same type.

## Group Token

One player acts as the group token controller while deployed on a map. The group token, representing the entire group, moves at the controller's speed, one square at a time. The controller removes obscuring map tiles within one square of its position. Once movement stops, PCs take one turn in initiative order, performing free actions and up to one action and one reaction during a group token turn.

Certain characters have bonus features while controlling the group token. The PC with the highest movement or the best bonus features while moving the group token typically becomes the group token controller.

### World Map

While on the world map, if the group token triggers an encounter by moving onto a foothold, observe the direction in which the group token moved and leave the group token on the foothold. Set up an encounter map matching the group token's primary terrain. The players enter the map and place their tokens within one square of the side they entered the map in as close to marching order as possible before adding any creatures or map features onto the map. Once an encounter resolves, the players remove their tokens from the map, the GM puts away the encounter map, and gameplay resumes on the world map.

### Dungeon Encounter

While on a dungeon map, if the group token triggers an encounter, replace the group token with the player's tokens as close to marching order as possible before placing any creatures or map features onto the map. Once an encounter resolves, remove the player's tokens from the map and place the group token back onto the map on an accessible dungeon tile not obscured by a fog of war tile.

# Making An Attack

Whether you’re striking with a weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you deal damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

## Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s DC, the attack hits. A character's DC equals its Defense. A creature or game feature's DC is usually determined by encounter type (minion, elite, boss) and LEVEL, though your GM may modify DC values on some encounters.

### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability score and LEVEL. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses a modifier usually determined by encounter type (minion, elite, boss) and LEVEL. However, your GM may adjust modifiers on some encounters.

**Ability Score.** The ability score used for a weapon attack is usually STR or DEX. At character creation, players choose which ability their characters use. Once this choice is made, it is permanent. Monsters usually use the larger of the two ability scores for a weapon attack.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability score used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**LEVEL.** You add LEVEL to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.

### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes, circumstances can be favorable or unfavorable to a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s DC. This is called a critical hit.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s DC. This is called a critical failure.

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the _invisibility_ spell, or lurking in magical darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 1 square of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand‑to‑hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 1‑square **reach** and can thus attack targets within 1 square of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 1 square, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head‑butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike is limited to dealing 1 point of bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Some classes, such as the monk, may deal extra damage with unarmed strikes.

#### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon you're holding in one hand, you can make an additional attack with a different light weapon you're holding in the other hand.

If either weapon can be used to make a ranged attack, you can throw it instead of making a melee attack.

#### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a STR check contested by the target’s STR or DEX check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 1 square away from you.

# Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three‑quarters cover, the target has three‑quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to DEX checks to resist attacks, spells, or game features directed at the target. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to DEX checks to resist attacks, spells, or game features directed at the target. A target has three‑quarters cover if about three‑quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

# Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well‑placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a _fireball_ spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

## Health

A creature's health represents a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and favorable circumstances. Creatures with a higher MAX Wounds score (see _Reaching MAX Wounds_ below) are more difficult to kill. Those with a lower MAX Wounds score are more fragile.

A creature’s health is determined by its number of wounds, which can be any number from 0 to a maximum number of wounds equal to its MAX Wounds score. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, it first checks whether or not any relevant game features reduce the damage. The remaining damage is dealt to a creature as an equal amount of wounds. Gaining wounds does not affect a creature’s capabilities until the number of wounds accumulated equals or exceeds their MAX Wounds score.

## Damage

Each **weapon**, **spell**, harmful monster ability, or game feature deals a minimum of 1 point of damage. Particularly damaging weapons, spells, harmful monster abilities, or game features may deal 2 or more damage. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, all of them receive the same amount of damage. For example, when a wizard casts _fireball_ or a cleric casts _flame strike_, the spell’s damage is dealt to all creatures caught in spell's area of effect.

### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to double the attack’s damage against the target. A critical hit does not double the damage of any secondary game features resolved after the attack.

For example, suppose you are playing a character with the damage group role and attack with a dagger, which deals 1 point of piercing damage on a successful attack. If you score a critical hit with the dagger, it deals 2 points of damage, rather than 1. Since you have the damage group role, after resolving the attack, you then deal 1 point of piercing damage to a creature within 1 square of the original target. The extra damage isn't doubled. If the attack involves additional damage, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you double this damage as well.

### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**Acid.** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**Bludgeoning.** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**Cold.** The elemental chill radiating from an ice mephit’s claws and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**Fire.** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**Force.** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including _magic missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.

**Lightning.** A _lightning bolt_ spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.

**Piercing.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s _flame strike_ spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _thunderwave_ spell, deals thunder damage.

Attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects sometimes simultaneously deal multiple types of damage. When this happens, the damage type that is least resisted by the target is assigned.

## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 3 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 1. The 3 damage is first reduced by 1 and then halved, so the creature takes 1 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three‐quarters.

## Healing

All healing effects provide a minimum of 1 point of healing. Particularly strong healing may provide 2 or more points of healing. For each point of healing, you discard 1 wound. When you receive healing, you also stabilize. You stabilize from healing even if the amount of healing is reduced to 0.

Unless it results in death, wounds aren't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can discard a creature's wounds, and magical methods such as a _cure wounds_ spell or a potion of healing can discard wounds in an instant.

A creature can never have less than 0 wounds, so any additional wounds discarded are ignored. For example, a druid grants a ranger 2 points of healing, allowing the ranger to discard 2 wounds. If the ranger only has 1 wound, the ranger discards 1 wound, not 2.

A creature that has died can’t discard wounds until magic such as the _revivify spell_ has restored it to life.

## Reaching MAX Wounds

When you gain enough wounds to equal or exceed your MAX Wounds score, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage assigns enough wounds to exceed your MAX Wounds score, you die if the number of exceeding wounds is equal to or greater than your MAX Wounds score.

For example, a cleric with MAX Wounds 6 currently has 3 wounds. If she takes 9 damage from an attack, she gains enough wounds to reach MAX Wounds, but 6 additional wounds remain. Because the remaining wounds equal her MAX Wounds score, the cleric dies.

### Falling Unconscious

If damage assigns enough wounds to equal or exceed your MAX Wounds score and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-­A). This unconsciousness ends if you receive healing.

### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with MAX Wounds, you must spend your turn making a special d20 roll, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other die rolls, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on death saves.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you receive healing or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you receive 1 point of healing.

**Taking damage while at MAX Wounds.** If you take any damage while you have MAX Wounds, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage assigns enough damage to meet or exceed your MAX Wounds score, you suffer instant death.

### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a dying creature at MAX Wounds is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 WIS check.

A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it might still be at MAX Wounds, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed receives 1 point of healing at the end of the encounter and discards the unconscious condition.

### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it reaches MAX Wounds, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters (NPCs) are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

## Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker adds enough wounds to a creature to reach its MAX Wounds score with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and becomes stabilized.

## Bolster

Some spells and special abilities confer bolster, a special pool of points used as a buffer against wounds.

When you have a bolster pool and take 1 or more wounds, you first reduce the number of wounds received by your bolster pool. Any leftover wounds carry over. For example, if you have bolster 1 and take 3 wounds, you lose bolster and then take 2 wounds.

Healing can’t restore a bolster pool, and they can’t be added together. If you have a bolster pool and receive more, you decide whether to keep the bolster pool you have or to gain the new one. For example, if a spell grants you bolster 1 when you already have bolster 2, you can have 1 or 2, not 3.

If you are at MAX Wounds, receiving a bolster pool doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. Only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you bolster has a duration, your bolster pool lasts until they’re depleted or until the end of the game session.

# Your Turn

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first, and you can split up your movement before and after taking an action. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

You also have access to your reaction, a special action that can be taken during your turn or on someone else's.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions” section. Many class and game features provide additional options for your action or reaction.

The “Movement and Position" section provides the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, taking a reaction, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions.”

# Actions

An action is a discrete measurement of time and effort. Using certain game features, casting spells, and making attacks require you to discard your action. Once discarded, an action remains discarded until the beginning of your next turn.

When you discard your action, you can take one of the actions presented here, take an action you gained from a game feature, or take an action you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

Return your discarded actions at the start of a game session and at the beginning of your turn.

## Action

**_Discard your action to take one action_.** You discard your action during your turn to use most game features, spells, and attacks. If a game feature has the Action keyword, you use your discarded action to take another action detailed in its description.

> Life requires some effort to maintain. You must physically attend to your life and take action to promote your health and wellness. Your body, mind, and essence or spirit need loving kindness, loving guidance, and self-care for optimal health. There is no away-from-keyboard (AFK) in RL. There is no auto-follow or AFK leveling. You must take action if you are to meet your goals in life. If you don't take action in your life, who will?

## Attack

**_Discard your action to Attack_.** The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the action.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

## Cast a Spell

**_Discard your action to Cast a Spell_.** Spellcasters and many monsters have access to spells and can use them to great effect. Spells typically discard your action to cast. If the spell has a different casting time, such as 1 reaction, it will be listed in the spell's description.

## Dash (Action, Turn)

After applying any modifiers, you gain extra movement for the current turn, equal to your speed. For example, with a speed of 6, you can move up to 12 squares on your turn if you Dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount.

## Disengage (Action, Turn)

Until the end of your turn, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Dodge (Action, Turn)

Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make DEX checks with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix PH-A) or if your speed drops to 0.

## Help (Action, Turn)

You lend aid to another creature in the completion of a task. The creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within your reach. You can feint, distract the target, or, in some other way, team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

## Hide (Action, Turn)

You make a DEX check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section.

## Interact with an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Interact with an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

You gain one free Interact with an Object action each turn. Additional Interact with an Object actions discard your action.

## Reaction

**_Discard your reaction to use certain game features, spells, and situations_.** A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.

The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.

## Ready (Action)

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. The Ready action allows you to discard your reaction to act before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include, “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either discard your reaction and take your action right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release when you discard your reaction during the triggered event. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _web_ spell and readying a _magic missile_, your _web_ spell ends.

## Search (Action)

You devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a WIS check or an INT check.

# Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

## Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 1 square of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 6 squares, you must spend 3 squares of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 3 squares of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX check or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 1 square of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same check.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 1 square of it.

## Controlling a Mount

While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

# Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

# Spellcasting

Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.

This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

> Some gaming worlds, such as those in science fantasy, futuristic, or modern settings, may refer to "magic" as preternatural or technological rather than "magical."
>
> You can use these same spellcasting rules, replacing terms and common usage. For example, preternatural effects may require the use of an implement such as an 8-inch to 1-foot-long thin piece of synthetic, wood, metal, or composite material infused with energy instead of a free hand, which effectively still requires a free hand to grasp the implement.
>
> You can replace or "reskin" how magic works in your game, but you must still use these spellcasting rules and limitations. 

## What Is a Spell?

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-­A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and understanding to do so.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 7. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) _magic missile_ at 1st level and the earth-­shaking _earthquake_ at 7th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level correspond directly. To cast a spell, your level must equal or exceed the spell's level. For example, a character must be at least 2nd-level to cast a 2nd-­level spell, and the most powerful spells, 7th-level, become available during character level 7.

Spellcasters gain access to paragon spells at level 6 and epic spells at level 7 through the paragon spell and epic spell upgrades, respectively. These spells are potent magical effects that can only be cast once per game session.

### Known and Prepared Spells

Spellcasters must have the spell firmly fixed in mind before they can use it, or they must have access to the spell with a magic item. Spellcasters have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-­using monsters. Wizards are an exception and may learn any number of spells.

### Mana

Regardless of how many spells casters know, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell requires spending magic energy known as mana. Casting spells is also physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so.

When characters cast a spell, they expend an amount of mana equal to that spell’s level. Alternatively, if a spell description allows it, they can spend additional mana to augment the spell's effects, provided the total mana spent does not exceed LEVEL.

Your Mana feature is followed by a number, representing the amount of Mana you receive at the beginning of a game session. Some class and game features replenish mana during a game session.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using mana. For example, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way. Spells cast this way cannot be augmented with additional mana.

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level

When a spellcaster casts a spell with more mana than its level, the spell assumes a higher level for that casting equal to the amount of mana spent. For instance, if a spellcaster spends 2 mana to cast _magic missile_, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level.

Some spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

>#### Casting in Armor
>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect repeatedly. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell can only be cast outside of a combat encounter and generally takes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t require using mana to cast or other resources needed to cast the spell, such as the pact magic feature. The ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known.

## Casting a Spell

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Some spells use the Cast a Spell action differently. When this happens, the spell will include a casting time. For example, the _healing word_ spell has a casting time of instant. This means you do not discard your action to take the Cast a Spell action to cast the spell. If a spell's casting time is listed as 1 reaction, you discard your reaction instead of your action when taking the Cast a Spell action.

#### Casting Multiple Spells During Your Turn

If you take the Cast a Spell action on your turn without discarding your action, you can take the Cast a Spell action one additional time during the same turn, but you can only cast a cantrip, and you discard your action, even if the spell uses a different casting time.

#### Reactions

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast. Ritual spells can only be cast outside of an encounter. Spells with a casting time of Rest can only be cast during a rest. Some spells can only be cast at HQ or when completing a downtime round, listed as HQ or Downtime, respectively. These spells may take hours or even a day to cast. If the location where you spend a downtime round loses HQ protection, you lose the spell without expending mana. You must use another downtime round at a location with HQ protection to cast it again.

### Cooldown

Some powerful spells have the cooldown keyword. Spells with a cooldown can only be cast once per game session.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like _magic missile_, the target is a creature. For a spell like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in squares. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the _shield_ spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V) or somatic (S) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)

Some spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

### Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. Most spells have an instantaneous duration. Spells with longer durations have a duration section. Longer durations include encounter and Recall. Some spells specify that their effects last until they are dispelled or destroyed. These spells also end when the game session ends.

#### Encounter

A number of spells have durations longer than an instant but shorter than a game session. These spells persist for the length of an encounter.

#### Instantaneous

Most spell durations are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled because its magic exists only for an instant. A spell without a listed duration has an instantaneous duration.

#### Recall

Some spells have lingering effects that last well beyond an encounter but less than a day. Such a spell lasts until Recall.

### Concentration

Most spells with durations longer than instantaneous require you to maintain concentration to keep their magic active, as indicated with the concentration keyword. If you lose concentration on a spell, it ends.

You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
- **Casting another spell with the concentration keyword.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell with the concentration keyword. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed unless a spell says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

You must have a clear path to target something so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect

Spells such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

#### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Resisting Spells

Many spells specify that a target can make an ability check to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the check and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 10 + your spellcasting ability. Class upgrades may further modify your DC.

### Attack Rolls

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals 2 + your spellcasting ability. Class upgrades may further modify your spell attack bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 1 square of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.

>#### The Schools of Magic
>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
>
>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
>
>**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
>
>**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
>
>**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
>
>**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
>**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
>
>**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
>
>**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
>
>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.
>
>**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once and does not get to roll four action dice.

### Detect Magic (Action, Turn)

Spellcasters have an innate ability to perceive the flow of magic. You sense the presence of magic up to 6 squares away. If you sense magic in this way, you can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

This awareness can penetrate most barriers. However, it is blocked by one square of stone, metal, wood, or dirt and a thin sheet of lead.

## Spell Descriptions

## Spells (A)

### Acid Arrow

- _2nd-level evocation_
- **Range:** LOS
- **Components:** V, S

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1 acid damage immediately and 1 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this at a higher level, the damage (both initial and later) increases by +1 for each level above 2nd.

### Acid Splash

- _Conjuration cantrip_
- **Range:** 12
- **Components:** V, S

You hurl a bubble of acid at a creature within range or two creatures within range within 1 square of each other. A target must succeed on a DEX check or take 1 acid damage.

### Aid

- _2nd-level abjuration_
- **Range:** 6
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Recall

Your spell protects your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target gains bolster 2.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell at a higher level, increase the bolster value by +1 for each level above 2nd.

### Alter Self

- _2nd-­level transmutation_
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Encounter (Concentration)

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell.

**_Aquatic Adaptation_.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**_Change Appearance_.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.

**_Natural Weapons_.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

While the spell lasts, you gain the following game feature.

**_Alter Self (Action)_.** End your current alter self option and then choose and gain an alter self option.

### Animal Friendship

- _1st-­level enchantment_
- **Range:** 6
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Recall

This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast is awakened as with the _awaken_ spell, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a WIS check or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell at a higher level, you can affect one additional beast for each level above 1st.

#### Animal Messenger
|_2nd-­level enchantment (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-­haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-­five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering 2 world map tiles for a flying messenger, or 1 world map tile for other animals. When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.|
|**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell at a higher level, the distance the animal messenger travels increases by +1 world map tile for each slot level above 2nd.|

#### Arcane Lock

|**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)|
|**Duration:** Until dispelled|
||
|You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 1 square of the object, suppresses this spell long enough to allow passage. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for the rest of the encounter.|
|While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.|

#### Arcanist’s Magic Aura
|_2nd-­level illusion_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.|
|When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.|
|**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as when a spellcaster uses detect magic that detects magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.|
|**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.|

#### Augury
|_2nd-­level divination (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V, S, M (talisman)|
|**Duration:** Instantaneous|
||
|By casting gem-­inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take before recalling back to HQ. The GM rolls an action die (d6) and compares the number of bolt symbols to the following possible omens:|
||
- 1 (1 bolt): Weal, for good results
- 6 (2 bolts): Woe, for bad results
- 2-5 (blank): Mixed or unclear results

|  |
|:-|
|The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.|
|The GM makes any necessary adjustments to the narrative to incorporate these readings into the story.|

## Spells (B)

### Beast Link

- 2nd-level divination
- Range: Touch
- Components: S

#### Branding Smite
|_2nd-­level evocation_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** Instantaneous|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Encounter (Concentration)|

Calm Emotions
2nd-­level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 12
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 4-square radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a CHA check. If a creature fails its check, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

#### Conjure Animal

|The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, the animal defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.|
|The GM has the creatures’ statistics.|

## Spells (D)

### Disguise Self

- _1st-level illusion_
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Encounter

You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you discard your action to dismiss it. You can seem shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between, but your actual size remains the same. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you will bump into you while it is seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can discard its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an INT check.

## Spells (E)

### Eldritch Blast

- _Evocation cantrip_
- **Range:** LOS
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 2nd level, three beams at 4th level, and four beams at 6th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

### Spells (F)

#### False Life
|_1st-level necromancy_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V,S|
|**Duration:** Encounter|
||
|Drawing upon a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain bolster 1.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, your bolster increases by +1 for each spell level above 1st.|

### Find Familiar (Cooldown)

- _1st-level conjuration (ritual)_
- **Range:** 2 squares
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes the form of a critter with magic traits. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of a minion unless otherwise indicated in its description in addition to the chosen form, though it is a fey or elemental (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar's DEX checks for stealth and WIS checks related to perception gain advantage. Choose the familiar's form.

**_Amphibian_.** Your familiar takes the form of a frog or salamander. Your familiar breathes water and gains a swim speed of 6 squares.

**_Aquatic_.** Your familiar takes the form of a fish or octopus. Your familiar disappears if it spends more than 1 round outside of a body of water. It breathes water and gains a swim speed of 12 squares.

**_Aracnid_.** Your familiar takes the form of an eight-legged animal with a chitinous shell. Your arachnid familiar gains a climb speed of 6 squares.

**_Avian_.** Your familiar takes the form of a bird of prey and gains a fly speed of 12 squares.

**_Quadruped_.** Your familiar takes the form of a furry mammal with four limbs. Whenever you reveal an obscuring map tile while you are the group token controller, your familiar may also reveal an additional obscuring map tile up to 2 squares away.

**_Serpentes_.** Your familiar takes the form of a snake. Whenever your familiar successfully attacks a creature, it must make a CON check or gain the poisoned condition.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it gains the same initiative and acts on your turn. A familiar can't attack unless you first discard your action. Similarly, a familiar can't take an opportunity attack unless you first discard your reaction. Your familiar can take other actions as normal, except your familiar's help action gains **_Rest 2_**.

When the familiar reaches MAX Wounds, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears in an unoccupied space within range after you cast this spell again.

While your familiar is on the same map, you can communicate with it telepathically, and you gain the following game features.

**_Familiar Link (Action)_.** You see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can continue to discard your action at the start of each of your turns to extend this duration an additional turn.

**_Dismiss Familiar (Action)_.** You temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.

**_Call Familiar (Action)_.** You summon a temporarily dismissed familiar, causing it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 6 squares of you.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen critter.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be on the same map, and it must discard its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

|**Range:** 12|
|**Components:** V, S|

### Sanctuary

- _1st-level abjuration_
- **Casting Time:** Instant
- **Range:** 6 squares
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Encounter

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature that targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a WIS check. The creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell on a failed check. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as a _fireball_ explosion.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.

#### Simulacrum
|7th-level illusion|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 downtime round|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S|
|**Duration:** Until dispelled|
||
|You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but its MAX Wounds is half the creature’s MAX Wounds, and it is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.|
|The simulacrum is friendly to you and the creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes, and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain mana once spent. Simulacrums cannot cast _simulacrum_ or _wish_.|
|Once you cast _simulacrum_, you cannot cast it again until you gain a level of experience.|
|If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, spending 1 or more Coin to heal an equal number of wounds. The simulacrum lasts until it reaches MAX Wounds, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.|
|If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.|

# Encounters

5eFP uses encounters to describe the adversity PCs find while exploring maps. Traps, unfavorable environmental conditions, creatures, and challenging story situations with uncertain oucomes are all considered encounters. Use the following table to determine the base statistics for all encounters. Add LEVEL to the base values except for forced movement, minion damage, and minion MAX wounds.

|   |**Minion**|**Elite**|**Boss**|
|--:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
|**Difficulty Class (DC)**|12|13|14|
|**Bonus**|+2|+3|+4|
|**Damage**|1|1|1|
|**MAX Wounds**|1|2|4|
|**Forced Movement**|1|1 or 2|2|

**Minion.** Minions represent simple encounters. Monster encounters treat minions as creatures with minimal stats that can only sustain one point of damage with MAX wounds of 1. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must meet a single challenge to overcome the encounter. Examples: a trap that does not reset or picking a lock. While minion monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster encounters may take minutes to resolve.

Some creature minions have the critter tag. Critters are typically tiny or small creatures. They deal 0 damage, have a +1 bonus and a DC of 10. Critters can be upgraded. An upgraded critter shares the same base statistics as minions, but they do not add LEVEL to their base values. A critter can be further upgraded to add LEVEL to its base statistics, ignoring movement, damage, and MAX wounds as normal.

**Elite.** Elites represent advanced encounters which may include a number of minion encounters. Monster encounters treat elites as creatures with advanced stats and features. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must overcome adversity several times before achieving completion. Examples: convince a skeptical creature of something or gather clues. While elite monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster elite encounters may take an hour to resolve.

**Boss.** Boss encounters are difficult and include minion and elite encounters. Monster encounters treat bosses as creatures with advanced stats, features, and special tactics benefiting from the presence of one or more minions. Non-monster encounters represent difficult situations where PCs must overcome challenging conditions several times while also dealing with some simultaneous minion and elite encounters. Non-monster boss encounters resolve after all non-monster minion encounters are resolved. Examples: attempt to sway the opinion of an adversary and associated followers or put out a fire spreading through a village while rescuing trapped villagers. While boss monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster boss encounters may take several hours to resolve.

**LEVEL.** The current level of play.

**Difficulty Class (DC).** If an encounter attack or game feature requires an ability check, set the DC to this number. If the PCs take action against an encounter resulting in a melee or ranged attack, they must hit a DC equal to this number to succeed.

**Bonus.** If any part of an encounter relies on a modifier to a d20 roll, it uses this number as the modifier. An encounter may list one or more ability scores with bonuses in its description. If the encounter rolls an ability check with one of the listed ability scores, add its bonus to the result.

If an encounter relies on a passive bonus, determine the passive bonus by adding 10 to the value of this bonus.

**Damage.** If any part of the encounter deals damage, it deals a number of points of damage equal to this number.

**MAX Wounds.** If any part of the encounter can sustain points of damage, it gains MAX wounds equal to this number. Any PC action taken to end an encounter is considered damage. Thus, a diplomatic crisis may have a MAX wounds stat representing how many times the PCs must affect the encounter before it resolves.

**Forced Movement.** If any part of the encounter imposes forced movement, this number represents the number of squares of forced movement. If no direction is stated, the movement is a push.

## Customizing Encounters

The encounter statistics provided represent average values. Any number of statistics may be increased by up to +(LEVEL), provided the same amount decreases another statistic. Only stats used in an encounter can be customized. For example, during a level 1 monster encounter, the GM increases an elite awakened shrub's DC by +1. The cost of increasing the minion's DC is paid by decreasing its attack modifier by -1. However, the GM cannot choose to pay for this increase by decreasing its forced movement by -1 because the elite doesn't have a game feature using forced movement.

A minion's MAX wounds and damage cannot be customized.

Encounter statistics cannot be reduced below the following values:
- **Damage** 1
- **DC** 12
- **Bonus** +2
- **Speed** 2
- **MAX Wounds (elite)** 2
- **MAX Wounds (boss)** 5

### Elite Monster Encounter Templates (in progress ...)

Elite creatures within an encounter can be further customized with healer, mage, scoundrel, and warrior templates. Add the template's game features to the designated creature or creatures in an encounter.

### Healer Template
- MAX Wounds +1
- Defense +1
- (Action, Cooldown): target a creature within 6 squares. For the rest of the encounter, if the target is assigned 1 or more points of damage, reduce that damage by 1. If another friendly creature is within 6 squares of the target, move this beneficial effect onto it at the end of the turn, favoring the target with more wounds.

### Scoundrel Template
- MAX Wounds +1
- Defense +1
- Immunity to the taunt condition

### Mage Template
- Defense -2
- The elite gains two magic attacks.
    - **_Dart_ (action)** deals magic damage to one creature within 6 squares, reducing its speed by 2 until the beginning of the elite's next turn.
    - **_Burst_ (action)** deals magic damage to all creatures within 1 square.
-  The elite gains limited use of an additional magic attack. The elite may use this magic attack twice per encounter.
    - **_Line_ (action)** affects all creatures who fail a DEX check within a 6-square by 1-square line originating from the elite. _Line_ deals magic damage to a target at the start of each of their turns. A creature can spend its action to remove this effect or remove it from another creature within 1 square.

### Warrior Template
- Defense +2
- MAX Wounds +2
- Multiattack: The elite makes two attacks.

# Encounter Type

Encounter type describes the kind of encounter you discover.

## Treasure

A treasure encounter may include minion, elite, and boss treasure.

### Minion Treasure

A treasure might be hidden, in plain sight, trapped, or untrapped.

### Elite Treasure

Treasure of type elite rewards an additional ⛁ once discovered. Elite treasures are often protected by an elite trap or one minion monster encounter.

### Boss Treasure

Boss treasures award the greatest amount of bonus Coin, but are the most difficult to finish. These encounters award an additional ⛁ upon discovery and potentially contain one or more bonus Coin. It is difficult, if not impossible, to unlock all boss treasure bonus Coin. A creature can discard its action on its turn to make a WIS check. Boss treasures require (MAX Wounds) successful WIS checks to find ⛁, and may require overcoming a boss trap or two elite monsters before resolving.

## Monster

Monster encounters use the encounter stats provided to determine the monster's strengths and statistics. Completing a monster encounter decreases the time marker by 1.

>Monster encounters use one of three templates (testing):
>
>- **Minion.** Place (number of PCs + 1) minions onto the playing field.
>- **Elite.** As **Minion** plus add 2 elites onto the playing field.
>- **Boss.** As **Elite** plus add 1 boss onto the playing field adjacent to a minion.
>
>Solo-Play (testing):
>- **Elite.** As **Minion** plus add 1 elite onto the playing field.
>- **Boss.** As **Minion** plus add 1 boss onto the playing field.

### Minion, Elite, and Boss Features

A minion uses only minion features. Elites combine minion and elite characteristics. Bosses combine both minion and elite features with boss features.

### Size

### Type

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also to other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals or the Primordials. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The genie species, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid species are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

#### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting undead would work against any monster that has the undead tag.

### Alignment

A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-­‐‑aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.

### Size

### Speed

A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn measured in squares.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-­based locomotion have a walking speed of 0.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

#### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.

#### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

#### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Abilities

The Abilities entry is reserved for monsters proficient in one or more abilities. For example, a very perceptive and stealthy monster might have bonuses to WIS and CHA checks. If a monster lists abilities, add LEVEL to related ability checks they make.

Passive abilities also benefit from listed abilities. Increase a passive score with a listed ability by + LEVEL.

Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-­than-­expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster’s senses. Senses are described below.

#### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

>#### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies
>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.

#### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

#### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on ability checks against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages

If a monster can speak, it knows common and can speak its own language, which sounds like gibberish to PCs who cannot decipher it. Sometimes a monster can understand common but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand common. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.

### Challenge

When determining the challenge of a monster encounter, let *N* equal the number of PCs + 1.

An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of adventurers should be able to defeat *N* minions, *N* minions with two elites, or *N* minions with one boss and two elites without suffering any deaths.

### Special Traits

Special traits (which appear before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting

A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher does not require mana to cast, is always cast at its lowest possible level, and can’t be cast at a higher level.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a mage might be able to innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the mage.

A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells.

#### Spellcasting

A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and mana, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.

A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the mana to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 2rd-­level _lightning bolt_ spell can cast it as a 3rd-level spell by spending an additional +1 mana.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its description.

#### Psionics

A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see (TBD).

**Creature vs. Target.** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

**Hit.** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation.

**Miss.** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. Defeated monsters using ammunition drop (basic ammunition).

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**Bolster X.** The notation "bolster X" means a monster gains a bolster pool equal to X.

**Encounter X.** The notation "Encounter X" means a special ability or game feature can be used X number of times during an encounter (minimum once).

**Cooldown X.** The notation “Cooldown X” means a special ability or feature can only be used X number of times during a game session (minimum once).

**Recharge X–Y.** The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll three action dice. If the number of actions equals one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a Rest.

For example, “Recharge 3–4” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls 3 or 4 actions after rolling three action dice.

**Rest X.** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability X number of times and then must finish a rest to use it again (minimum once).

### Equipment

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

### Bosses are Legendary Creatures

Bosses are legendary creatures because they can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. They can take special actions outside their turn, and they might exert magical or mundane influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a boss, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

### Legendary Actions

A boss can make special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Default Legendary Actions

All bosses automatically have the following legendary actions.

- **Attack.** The boss may move up to its speed and make one attack against a creature within range.
- **Combat Reflexes.** The boss regains its reaction.
- **Bolster LEVEL.** The boss gains a bolster pool equal to LEVEL. A boss can only activate this legendary action if a minion is within its LOS.

### A Boss' Lair

A boss might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a boss that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a boss can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the boss is defeated.

### Monster Descriptions

All monster descriptions are detailed in Appendix MM.

## Dungeon

Dungeon encounters use the encounter stats provided to determine the strength of any monsters, traps, and other adversity found on one floor of a contained, multi-room structure. Details such as light levels, room height, wall and floor composition, and type of doors in the dungeon are described first.

If a dungeon contains a passage leading to a higher or lower floor, the new floor would be a LEVEL+3 area. Floor changes are cumulative if they advance in the same direction. If a set of stairs in a level 1 dungeon leads down two floors, the new floor would be a LEVEL+6 (level 7) area. While searching the level 7 area, the PCs find a rope leading up through a hole in the floor. They climb the rope and find themselves in a level 4 area. Then, if the PCs find a staircase leading up, the next floor would return to a level 1 area.

Dungeons may have one or more bonus features.

### Bonus Feature: Danger Room

Danger rooms are always obscured by a reinforced and locked door or an opaque phenomenon keeping creatures out that is clearly labeled as deadly. PCs must first acknowledge the warnings to enter a danger room. Acknowledgment unlocks the door or phenomenon, allowing passage. If the PCs advance into a danger room, they must face a boss battle at difficulty (LEVEL + 2). The way out vanishes the moment the PCs reach the danger room and does not reappear until the end of the encounter. The monster encounter is set up as if there are five PCs (even if the party is less than five) and two bonus elites are added to the encounter. If the PCs overcome the encounter, an unlocked, trap-free ornate chest appears. Each PC may, in turn, approach the chest and open it. The PC then chooses and adds one treasure to their equipment from three discovered treasures, discarding the other two choices. PCs choose one treasure from three available treasures: class, advanced, or magic item. Roll/draw the treasures and pick one to keep.

> ### Danger Room Treasures
> 
>> Danger rooms are unique game zones that contain a very powerful boss (super boss) monster encounter, requiring optimization with the ideal gear, features, group roles, and abilities you can muster into a five-player party. You discover treasure from three potential treasure types once you clear a danger room.
>>
>> **Class.** Treasure your class considers essential. For example, barbarians might discover handaxes, javelins, a battle axe, a shield, light armor, or medium armor
>>
>> **Advanced.** Rare items your class considers valuable. For example, barbarians might discover a healing potion, a martial weapon, trade goods, or ⛁
>>
>> **Magic Item.** The best items in the game for your class. For example, barbarians might discover magic armor, weapons, shields, rings, necklaces, vestments

## Trap

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-­filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as _glyph of warding_ and _symbol_ that function as traps.

#### Traps in Play

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it. These choices are randomly determined when a trap is discovered.

**Triggering a Trap.** Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the _glyph of warding_ spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.

**Detecting and Disabling a Trap.** Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.

A trap uses the encounter stats provided to determine the checks needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a WIS check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive WIS score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an INT check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a DEX check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.

Any character with the spellcasting feature can attempt a WIS check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. In addition, _dispel magic_ also has a chance of disabling most magic traps.

In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.

**Trap Effects.** The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.

> MINION TRAPS
>
>> Traps of type minion do not reset after triggering.
>>
> ELITE TRAPS
>
>> Traps of type elite require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to disable and may trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing.
>>
> BOSS TRAPS
>
>> The deadliest traps are boss traps. These hazards are difficult, if not impossible, to bypass or avoid, require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to disable, and may trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing. Also, boss traps have several smaller components that trigger independently. PCs must deal with or remove all of these smaller components, or the boss trap resets.

## Settlement

A settlement uses the encounter stats provided to determine the checks needed to find it, resolve the encounter, or both.

> MINION SETTLEMENT
>
>> Minion settlements are small communities without a council or leader, consisting of hamlets or loose collections of homes or shelters.
>>
> ELITE SETTLEMENT
>
>> Settlements of type elite are villages with (MAX Wounds) council members, typically a mayor or leader, and a militia. An elite settlement encounter requires (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to resolve the encounter before finishing.
>>
> BOSS SETTLEMENT
>
>> The largest communities are boss settlements. These are towns or city-castles with (MAX Wounds) council members, a mayor or leader (some have multiple leaders), a militia, city guard, and barracks that are difficult, if not impossible, to bypass or avoid, require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to resolve the encounter which may have secondary events that trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing. Also, boss settlements have several smaller communities that trigger independent minion encounters. PCs must deal with or remove all of these triggered minion encounters or the boss settlement encounter resets.
>>
>> While a boss settlement encounter is unresolved, it gains bolster (LEVEL) after all PCs have finished taking their turn.

## Campfire

A campfire encounter usually doesn't need encounter stats to resolve, but you can use the provided stats if necessary.

Campfire encounters are initiated during a rest and resolve at the end of the rest. Campfire encounters should take up at most 10 minutes of game-session time. When a campfire scene resolves, the group token controller reveals obscuring map tiles up to 3 squares away from the group token.

Campfire encounters do not require the presence of a campfire to be considered campfire encounters.

During a campfire encounter, one PC volunteers to set the scene and drives the initial interaction while the others join in and play with the focus created in the story. Typically, the volunteer desires to initiate a specific kind of roleplaying scenario. PCs can have conversations, plan their next move, talk to locals, gather clues, share a meal, play games, and more.

When you discover a campfire encounter, you can use it immediately or wait and use it later. You can only use it immediately if your party is not already in an encounter or the group token is not next to an unresolved foothold or setting requirement. If you use the campfire encounter immediately, your party gets the benefits of a short rest without it counting toward the total number of short rests available in the game session.

Discard any unused campfires on Recall.

# Appendix PH-A: Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded

- A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Charmed

- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

## Deafened

- A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

> ## Exhaustion
>
> Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.
>
> |Level|Effect|
> |:-:|:-|
> |1|Disadvantage on ability checks|
> |2|Speed halved|
> |3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks|
> |4|Hit point maximum halved|
> |5|Speed reduced to 0|
> |6+|Death|

## Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within LOS.
- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

## Incapacitated

- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

## Invisible

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.


## Paralyzed

- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails STR and DEX checks.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 1 square of the creature.

## Petrified

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails STR and DEX ability checks.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

## Poisoned

- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

## Prone

- A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

## Restrained

- A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on DEX checks.

## Stunned

- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails STR and DEX checks.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

## Taunted

- A taunted creature must include a PC with the defender group role as a target with any attack, effect, or spell whenever possible. Remove a creature's taunt condition whenever it receives 1 or more points of damage from a PC with the healer or damage group role.

## Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
- The creature automatically fails STR and DEX checks.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 1 square of the creature.

# Appendix SH-A: Setting Handbook

All details about the 5eFP practice you are joining, including read-aloud text, GM contact information, game backstory, world map, HQ information, how the game refers to Coin, the game's central conflict, the game's story directions, how PC Recall, how PCs fast travel, and the setting handbook requirement can be found in your setting handbook.

> Life rarely gives you a manual with instructions. So, create one for yourself.

## Read-Aloud Text

The read-aloud text in your setting handbook introduces the game world with a narrative that reveals each game world's ambiance, genre, and main story.

> Create RL read-aloud text, preferably positive and affirming, for the beginning of each new day. A great start would be "I am so grateful now that I am releasing old patterns that no longer serve me and my life."

## GM Contact Information

The GM Contact Information section lists all contact information for your 5eFP GM, including preferred contact method and game availability calendar.

> You are both the GM and the player in RL. You already know how to contact yourself, but are you truly communicating with yourself and your life? Include contact information regarding how you intend to make contact or, if you're starting with this process, affirm your desire to connect and better communicate with yourself and your life. Everything begins with a _wish_ or _desire_. Are you willing to set up and commit to a schedule of availability to ensure contact? If so, display your availability.

## Game Backstory

The Game Backstory section is at most 1 page long, contains game setting information, reveals common knowledge, and details the moments before the conflict began.

> What is your RL backstory? What has prompted you to join a 5eFP practice and create your RL setting handbook? Keep it brief, one or two paragraphs with two to three sentences each.

## World Map

> Your world map might be a vision board, an image, or images representing your life or the qualities, people, and experiences you're longing for.

## HQ Information

Each world map has an HQ, usually located at the center of the map, representing the central organization or organizing force responsible for maintaining the health and security of the game world or region. All PCs are peers and colleagues within this organization. You are objectively safe from the conflict at HQ, provided HQ receives the setting handbook requirement. Unless stated otherwise, PCs always begin and end a game session at HQ.

> Your real-life headquarters (HQ) could be your body, home, work, or department.

## Coin

> This is the money you use to pay your bills and taxes. It can also include what you consider valuable. Coin can also represent works of art, jewels and gems, a business, a thriving community, a loving partner, a beloved friend, or anything of great value to you.

## The Conflict

The Conflict is an event with ongoing effects that changed the game world into an unbalanced and afflicted state. A 5eFP game ends when the conflict is resolved.

> The game's conflict mirrors the central conflict within your life. What is the agitaor upseting your sense of balance and well-being? Become aware of the scary story when you think of your central conflict. This is your inner conflict, symbolically held through the conflict in the game. Every player experiences this conflict differently.

## Story Directions

## Recall

## Fast Travel

## Setting Handbook Requirement

PCs must complete this special task each game session, which might involve but isn't limited to placing and using an item, locating and gathering an item, finding and rescuing bystanders, gathering intelligence, or gathering a resource. For example, PCs must find and gather an herb, a starflower, in the _Enchanted Forest_ setting.

> Your setting handbook requirement in RL relates to your monthly expenses, property tax and taxes in general, work tasks, and self-care routine. These parts of life are required for life on Earth.

# Sample Setting Handbook

## Enchanted Forest

The Enchanted Forest's beloved Enchantress Queen (Queen) falls gravely ill as waves of weary and injured refugees enter through all four charmed gates of Castle Somnam (HQ), bringing harrowed tales of encroaching darkness. The Nightmare, a darkly magical reality overlaying the world and the realm known as the Plane of Shadow (Shadowfell), breached the Enchanted Forest's borders, spreading its long shadows across the land and transforming all it touched into strange and twisted reflections. The realm is no longer as it once was. Castle Somnam remains the only location unaffected by the Nightmare, thanks to the monarch's mystical protections imbued within the city castle's walls. An elite assembly of champions, known as the Queen's Heralds (Heralds), are charged with keeping the realm and its people healthy, thriving, and safe from harm.

You joined the Queen's Heralds and now, just before your graduation, you are called to participate in one important, final test: you must travel to the Crypt of the Continual Flame on foot deep into the Megalithic Highlands. You and your friends must make the journey alone unaided by your fellow students, peers, and instructors. You must make your way to the Crypt using a simple map. There, you will light your torch within the Hall of the Continual Flame and return it as proof of completion. Only then do you officially become a Herald.

# Appendix PO-A: Safe Space and Code Of Conduct

5eFP contributors, facilitators, and participants strive to create physical and virtual spaces where people have fun and feel safe. 5eFP game masters (GMs) take it very seriously if any player feels threatened or uncomfortable by another person in their space. When a GM is made aware of situations related to this, they will make sure that your concerns are heard and will take the necessary steps with you to respond to the problem. A 5eFP GM expects all participants to respect one another and to address unacceptable behaviors, including those instigated or perpetuated by the GM.

## POLICY STATEMENT

To create a safe, positive, and inclusive space free from harassment and discrimination and in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect, 5eFP has established the following code of conduct. Those who engage with 5eFP in any way are asked to understand and acknowledge this policy.

We acknowledge that a tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) with a focus on collaborative storytelling is an activity in which new ideas are explored, and boundaries are sometimes pushed. However, while we believe that people must be free to express themselves, it is unacceptable to exacerbate or reinforce discriminatory or harmful behaviors or views. The 5eFP community makes every effort to engage with people who share our philosophy. We hope and expect the content and work shared in our spaces to be done with care and without malicious intent.

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1. 5eFP uses consent in gaming to help promote a safe space for players to self-reflect through the characters they play and the game world their characters interact with.
    * 2019.09.13 [Consent in Gaming](https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/dcc548a4b9a3fa14b2f1def8178ae63fabcd1738/Consent_in_Gaming-2019-09-13.pdf)
    * 2019.09.13 [Form-Fillable Checklist](https://github.com/bhisaac/5eFP/blob/dcc548a4b9a3fa14b2f1def8178ae63fabcd1738/Consent%20in%20Gaming-Form%20Fillable%20Checklist-2019-09-13.pdf)
    * The most recent release can be found at [Monty Cook Games](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) and [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/288535/consent-in-gaming?term=consent%20in)

2. **Collaboration and Trust.** GMs and player characters (PCs) collaborate to create meaningful narratives during gameplay wherein story elements arise spontaneously. GMs cooperate with PCs when generating story ideas with a genuine interest in co-creating a story that pleases all participants. This cooperation extends to co-creation between players as well. Trust and collaboration are key to improving each player's experience and the game's story. GMs and players seek to understand and support each other while maintaining healthy boundaries established with consent in gaming. 5eFP GMs excel at storytelling, providing a game structure that holds the game's narrative with a neutral and balanced atmosphere free of compulsion and cruelty.
3. **No compulsion.** 5eFP is an at-will TRPG where you can join or leave practices freely, without compulsion. Rejoining a practice after being asked to leave or voluntarily leaving is not allowed, but you can join a different one. Benefits are gained only from active participation.
4. **Not just another TRPG.** 5eFP GMs hold the center for all players within their practice, requiring cultivated skills and capacities that demand resources and energy to sustain. They are selective about participants. Ideal candidates possess curiosity about themselves and others, along with emotional and social intelligence. Preferred candidates have an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying, even at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. Suitable candidates want to join the practice from a genuine desire for personal growth and self-awareness. Other reasons for joining are not accepted, and all admission fees are non-refundable.
5. **Guidance.** 5eFP can offer insight to players with existing counselors, therapists, teachers, or guides. Players are strongly encouraged to seek help with self-reflection and mindfulness guides. Without an objective observer to provide feedback, we easily fall into self-deception and denial. We often become blinded by our insecurities and shortcomings, making it difficult to overcome or release old patterns that no longer serve without their assistance. The content generated during 5eFP sessions can serve as material for discussion with these guides, who can also suggest suitable gameplay explorations.
6. **Therapeutic but _not therapy_.** 5eFP games can be therapeutic by revealing hidden parts of ourselves. Taking brief notes about these parts during the game is important, as these sessions are not therapy, and your GM won’t pause to process them. Players adapt and integrate experiences spontaneously. At the end of the session, there will be time for journaling and sharing with the group, and further processing can occur later with a guide or teacher.
7. **_One GM: One practice_.** A 5eFP game has one designated GM dedicated to the practice. The designated GM may recruit one or more additional GMs to help run repeatable quests within the practice. A GM can create a new practice only after an existing practice is completed or ends. A 5eFP practice ends before completion if the number of active players drops below eight. Players become inactive if they do not participate in the practice at least once each month. 
8. **_GMs do not fraternize with players within their practice_.** Friendships are welcomed, while romantic or intimate relationships between players and 5eFP GMs within a shared 5eFP practice are strongly discouraged. If a player wants to pursue a romantic or intimate relationship with their 5eFP GM, they must first agree to leave the GM's practice and refrain from joining any other practices led by that GM while the romantic or intimate relationship continues. They are encouraged to join a different 5eFP GM's practice.

### Who is this policy for?

This policy applies but is not limited to all 5eFP GMs, players participating in 5eFP game sessions, and public members joining 5eFP-related events.

### Where does this policy apply?

This policy applies to all managed events directly linked or associated with a 5eFP game, such as conferences, workshops, and other activities; after-event social spaces; and online while engaging with a 5eFP game’s virtual events or through email, social media, or texting.

## CODE OF CONDUCT*

The following is not exhaustive but is the minimum we expect from all 5eFP participants. GMs and players must all:

- Foster a safe environment that is free from physical, written, verbal, or sexual harassment, violence, bullying, or discrimination. Unacceptable behaviors include sexually harassing another person with unwanted or unwelcome behavior; physically or sexually assaulting another person; making derogatory remarks about an individual’s body, manner, or sexual activities; intimidating, threatening, or victimizing another person; discriminating against or treating someone less favorably due to their race, gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics.
- Be active and inclusive. Recognize that bigotry, bullying, and lack of consent are pervasive and rooted in the TRPG industry and within broader society. Do not tolerate racism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia, or ageism in any form, and actively challenge discriminatory behaviors and opinions. Do not tolerate backstabbing, bullying, infighting, intimidating, and disharmonious behaviors and actions.
- Respect boundaries. Be aware that each person is different and will have different personal and cultural boundaries. Pay attention to verbal and non-verbal signals, and respect others' wishes. This also means respecting possible rules and regulations to protect everyone from COVID-19 or other pandemics.
- Be aware of and challenge our prejudices and privileges. Consider what influences your words, opinions, and feelings and who they might exclude or harm.
- Respect how people choose to identify. Do not assume someone's gender identity, sexual preference, background, etc. Do not share this information with others without permission.
- Listen if someone challenges us about our behavior. It’s always hard to hear that your behavior is making someone uncomfortable. Do not become defensive – listen, reflect, and learn.
- Consume responsibly. Know your limits. The effects of alcohol and the consumption of intoxicants will not excuse inappropriate or harassing behavior.
- Take care of ourselves. Take care of your health and safety, and do not act in any way that puts you or others at risk.
- Respect the privacy of others. Please do not take photos/videos of others or share images of or information belonging to others without their express permission.
- Report damaging behaviors. If you are being harassed, witness harassment of someone else, or have concerns about another person’s conduct, please contact your 5eFP GM. You can report any inappropriate behavior or harassment via the contact details in your 5eFP setting handbook. 5eFP GMs can also submit reports for review by all players within a practice.

### What can you expect from 5eFP games and events?

5eFP GMs, players, and public members participating in 5eFP-related events will follow and uphold this Code of Conduct. This policy is communicated to all GMs, players, volunteers, scholars, artists, conference and workshop participants, collaborators, independent contractors, employees, and others who work within a 5eFP game. It will also be available publicly. 5eFP GMs will take action. When someone reports a breach of the code of conduct or is uncomfortable in any space (including online), a 5eFP GM works with the complainant to determine an appropriate response. This might involve:

- warning the offender
- removing the offender from the event/activity
- revoking the offender's 5eFP game membership
- contacting the police
- putting the complainant in touch with local support services

The 5eFP community will continue listening, learning, and reflecting, individually and with others. This policy will be regularly reviewed and updated. If you have any comments or suggestions about this policy, please contact your 5eFP GM using the details in your setting handbook.

*This code does not supersede an individual’s right to file a police report and/or investigation or seek legal counsel. To the extent that there is an inconsistency between the law and this policy, the law prevails.

# Appendix CH-A: SRD 5.1 Changes

(Complete list TBD)
 
- Species: Halfling (Lucky feature). Added the Turn keyword to this feature.
- Species: Elf. Elf weapon training is no longer a feature. Swords, shortbows, and longbows have the elf keyword. Any game feature with the elf keyword can be used by an elf, and is considered proficient. This works similarly for other species keywords and game features. The Trance feature was removed for two reasons: 1) the 5eFP core rule system won't be responsible for people sleeping (or not sleeping!) only 4 hours instead of the amount of time recommended by health care professionals and providers, and 2) 5eFP games don't do long rests anyway. They do downtime rounds instead. To compensate for this change, the Fey Ancestry feature now allows elves to spend additional coin when paying for rest and repairs during a round of downtime.
- Languages are reduced and simplified. All PCs now know common. Monsters that can speak, use a heavily accented common, and can speak their own language, which is called gibberish. The ranger can understand the gibberish of their favored enemies. Certain game features may grant the ability to understand gibberish.
- Removed backgrounds. Backgrounds were more integral when they awarded skill proficiencies. Your class determines your starting proficiencies and will attempt to add other proficiencies that your background traditionally offers. This is designed to reduce system bloat and complexity. The Perks system (TBA) will help bring back background bonuses. All background features are getting a facelift and will be included as Perk options.
- Celestials, demons, and devils were removed from the core game rules. They can be added back in through a campaign setting handbook. Iconic fantasy creatures like the unicorn, pegasus, and couatl are intelligent and magical beasts.
    - Two reasons for this change.
        - Removed to maintain a neutral stance on religious content. GMs and players may choose to reintroduce religious content detailed within the faith section of their setting handbook. 5eFP facilitates inner work without being strictly religious or non-religious.
        - Reduces system bloat (fewer monster types) and prevents the 5eFP game engine from getting consumed by the fires of good and evil, law and chaos. These can be found in the setting handbook if they are present in the game world.
- Dropped all saving throws except death saves. Death saves will eventually morph into a different and similar mechanic, but we are keeping it for now.
    - Use ability checks instead of saving throws. This makes it so much easier to teach new players and simplifies the character sheet!
- No grapple rules. The rules are too crunchy and cumbersome, and players often end up simply grappling every round, which is no longer an interesting option for gameplay. And we don't need 5eFP to be hyper realistic with regard to combat. Combat needs to go smoothly and efficiently. Creatures can have a grab feature that mimic the grapple rules. PCs will have options to reduce creature movement without needing to use grapple rules.
- Simple concentration rules. No need to roll concentration when you take damage. Spellcasters are trained and experienced with handling these situations by the spellcasting, pact magic, or another game feature that allows them to cast spells.
- The action economy includes three options: the action, reaction, and interact with an object. All three are discarded to fuel certain game features. Once discarded, they can no longer be used to fuel game features until they are regained. You regain a discarded action, reaction, and interact with an object at the start of your turn or when an encounter ends.
- Removed the bonus action.
    - Quality of life improvement for both PCs and GMs. The game doesn't need one more type of action to run smoothly. Reducing complexity and improving playability for new players, in particular. Bonus actions are revised and included within existing actions.
        - For example, you activate the Rage game feature as part of taking the Attack action. When casting a spell like _healing word_, you take the Cast a Spell action without discarding your action.
- Ability scores are now just bonuses (or penalties). So, WIS (+0) + INT (-1) = -1. Similarly, CON (+3) + DEX (-1) = 2.
- Hitpoints are dropped in favor of wounds and the MAX Wounds score. Wounds start at 0 and accumulate until reaching MAX Wounds.
- Dropped temporary hitpoints and other related game features for the bolster keyword and pool of points. If one or more wounds are assigned to you and you have bolster, you first spend your bolster points to negate the number of wounds assigned 1 for 1.
- AC changes to Defense (10 + DEX) and the protection provided through shields and light, medium, and heavy armor.
    - The defense score represents how well you evade attacks, whereas armor and shields reduce assigned damage and wounds. Taken together, they form the essence of what AC represents in 5e.
- Armor and game features that mimic armor reduce assigned damage and sometimes provide bolster.
- No long rest. The term short rest is now called rest. PCs can take up to two rests per game session. A rest is largely equivalent to a short rest, with additional game features making use of this mechanic. Specifically, those game features that reset and replenish upon completing a rest. Long rests are covered during downtime and downtime actions.
- Game features have acquired a number of keywords:
    - **Action.** A game feature with the action keyword requires you to discard your action to activate.
    - **Cooldown.** This feature can only be used once per game session. If a number follows the cooldown keyword, it represents the number of times the feature can be used before it's unavailable for the rest of the game session, but you are limited to using a game feature with the cooldown keyword only once during your turn.
    - **Encounter.** A feature with the encounter keyword can only be used within an encounter.
    - **Rest.** A feature with the rest keyword is reset and replenished when completing a rest. If a number follows the rest keyword, it represents the number of times you can use this feature, but no more than once per turn.
    - **Ki.** A game feature fueled by the use of the Ki game feature. Ki points are now represented by the Rest 3 keyword.
    - **Reaction.** Features with the reaction keyword require you to discard your reaction to use them.
- There are 7 levels of play. Each level roughly corresponds to three levels of play from traditional games with 20 levels. Level 1 is traditionally levels 1 through 3, level 2 is traditionally levels 4 through 6, etc.
    - For the longest time, all the games I joined ended at or just after level 7! As frustrating as that was, it got me thinking that maybe there are only seven levels. Twenty levels are a bit much for a new player to understand. And, as humans, we can generally hold no more than seven things/concepts/ideas/plans/etc. in our heads at any given time. Any more than seven and you risk losing critical details, harmony, and timing.
- Spells are simplified into seven levels, directly corresponding to character level for the spellcasting classes (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard). Paladin and Ranger, and certain class archetypes like the fighter's eldritch knight, unlock spell levels much slower, as explained in their game features.
    - 8th-level and 9th-level spells are now called Paragon and Epic spells, respectively. The ability to use the Cast a Spell action to cast a paragon or epic spell gains the cooldown keyword the moment you cast a paragon or epic spell.
    - Dropped spell slots in favor of mana. To cast a spell, you must spend its level in mana first. Cantrips do not require mana to cast.
    - Some game features, such as the Warlock Pact Magic feature and innate spellcasting, allow you to cast spells without spending any mana.
- Currency, gaining experience, and leveling up have changed dramatically. All three are linked to the Coin (⛁), a symbol that represents wealth, experience, and reputation. You spend Coin on available upgrades, allowing your character to level up what they want _à la carte_. Once the level 1 area is cleared, the level 2 area unlocks and the PCs level up to level 2.
- Defender, Damage, and Healing group roles are used when forming a group. The design goal for group roles is to allow any character to gain the basic tools for any of the three standard game strategies: turtle (absorb hits, allowing your teammates to deal with an encounter while it is distracted by you), HOT (heal over time), and DOT (damage over time).
    - Defender: You gain bolster 1 at the beginning of an encounter, act first before initiative is rolled, and impose the new taunt condition on adversaries, requiring them to include the Defender as a target as long as they are taunted.
    - Damage (Turn): You complete an action that targets a creature, dealing 1 damage to a different creature within 1 square of the target.
    - Healer (Turn): You complete an action that targets a creature, choosing a different creature within 1 square of the target. The chosen creature discards up to 1 wound and can make an additional ability check to resist an ongoing negative effect.
- Warlock changes
    - Changed class features, rephrasing them into neutral versions. The warlock is typically cast in a dark, occult frame. 5eFP departs from this and recreates the warlock as a neutral class that is neither inherently good nor evil.
        - Pact of the Chain: Imp --> Humunculous, Quasit --> Tiny Elemental
        - The Fiendish Vigor --> Eldritch Vigor
        - Agonizing Blast --> Performance Blast
        - Book of Shadows --> Tome of Secrets
        - Occult --> Arcane
        - The Fiend --> The Primordial
- Monk changes
    - Ki functions similarly to the warlock pact magic feature. Revising Ki abilities so they provide more worth when activated. Flurry of Blows remains the same, but could use an upgrade (TBA).
    - Patient Defense is more like a fighting stance, and has an encounter duration.
    - Step of the Wind is similarly stance-like and has an encounter duration.
    - Archetypes
        - Added a 5eFP version of Way of the Four Elements, simplified to "Way of the Elements"
        - Added a 5eFP version of Way of Tranquility
- More TBA

# Appendix FP-A: Running the Focus Practice

_This section is devoted to all Focus Practice details, including RL versions and RL nuances/symbolism of 5eFP mechanics and rules._

## The Rule of 1 and 20

The probability of rolling any number on a d20 (twenty-sided dice) is 1 in 20 or 5%. The probability of rolling any single number twice in a row on a d20 is 1 in 400 or 0.0025%. If you roll a 1 and then pass your turn or pause between die rolls, your chance of rolling a 1 on your next d20 roll returns to 5%. A d20 result of 20 is an automatic success, while 1 is an automatic failure. There is no free agency associated with automatic success or failure. So, 10% of all d20 die rolls produce results beyond your control. Let's take this to the next level and explore the rule of 20 and 1 in your real life.

## Swing (RNG)

Positive and negative circumstances are in constant flux within games that rely on random results and probability, but changing circumstances also play out in your real life. It's known as a swing when circumstances trend in a particular direction over time. Gamers also refer to this as RNG or random number generation, one metric gamers use to describe a game with random elements that significantly factor into their success or failure.

### Rule of 1: HOW DID I FAIL?

_No matter how advantaged or experienced you are, sometimes negative circumstances randomly arise, leading to automatic failure._

Sometimes, you are dealt a poor hand of cards and must strive to make them work together to serve your purposes. Accomplished gamers and those who achieve more of their life's goals push through the experience anyway and learn what they can from the experience they gain. Dwelling on unfavorable circumstances or failures doesn't improve your chance of meeting life goals. Rolling a 1 does not mean your next die roll will also be a 1. There is a near-zero chance that you will consecutively roll the same number twice. The chance is close enough to zero to treat it as such. Less than half of a percent is an outlier. Rolling the dice again will likely produce a _different_ number.

So, roll with the punches. Play that poor hand and draw new cards. Roll the dice again. If fear of rolling an automatic failure is all that slows you down, take comfort in knowing it happens only 5% of the time.

Part of reaching the next level of experience is understanding why a failure occurred, standing up, brushing oneself off, and trying again.

**_Negative Swing_.** When negative circumstances start trending, you are experiencing negative swing or the tendency for results to bottom out, flatten out, and fail instead of building up, coming together, and succeeding. If you learn to identify the signs of negative swing, you can adjust to it and plan your next steps accordingly.

- Plan a more conservative approach to whatever you do during a negative swing.
- It may be tempting to hold what you're going through with pessimism, resentment, or disappointment. It's natural to be disappointed with outcomes that do not end up matching what we want. Adopting a pessimistic attitude may make the negative swing last longer or cause the negative results to strengthen. The best approach is to remain as neutral as possible. It's OK and natural to be disappointed. Let this disappointment fuel your next efforts and actions after the swing ends.
- Failures that arise can be definitive endings, but perhaps they are not that defined. There is a tendency to read too much into negative swing. The universe isn't really out to get you; it just feels that way sometimes. You aren't cursed or destined to fail.
- Strive to see these failures as "not now" or "not like this" experiences and, ultimately, opportunities to educate and inform yourself for when (not if!) you try again.

### Rule of 20: HOW DID I WIN?

_No matter how disadvantaged or inexperienced we are, sometimes positive circumstances randomly arise, leading to automatic success._

We were dealt a poor hand of cards to work with, but somehow, the cards worked. We got exactly what we needed when we needed it. This success may be temporary, however. Rolling 20 doesn't guarantee the next roll will also be a 20. You roll a 20 twice in a row less than half of a percent of the time. It's a near-zero occurrence and should not be relied upon in achieving life goals.

Natural 20s occur once in a while automatically. This is why using an energy or skill we aren't proficient with is an acceptable strategy. While our results might be mediocre or average, not all skill tests must be spectacular. Often, we only need basic success to move the story (and our lives) forward.

Learn from automatic successes. If you can identify those factors that are out of your control, you can more easily see those that are. Did controllable circumstances and skill factor into your success? If the answer is yes, you know you are on the right track. If the answer is no, then jumping tracks and increasing or acquiring proficiencies may be necessary to achieve consistent, long-term results.

**_Positive Swing_.** When positive circumstances start trending, you are experiencing a positive swing or the tendency for results to build upward, come together, and succeed instead of bottoming out, flattening out, and failing. If you learn to identify the signs of positive swing, you can adjust to it and plan your next steps accordingly.

- Plan a more conservative approach to whatever you do during a positive swing.
- Successes that arise can be definitive beginnings, but perhaps they are not that defined. There is also a tendency to read too much into positive swing. The universe isn't really deciding to choose you as the "chosen one." Everyone experiences a positive swing once in a while. You aren't necessarily destined or fated to win or succeed.
- You can be less risk-averse during a positive swing.
- Set aside and preserve any gains or advances acquired through positive swing and avoid over-committing your efforts or overinvesting your time and energy. Use the resrouces you set aside during a postive swing for when a negative swing takes effect.
- Positive swing can end with little or no advanced warning.

### FINAL THOUGHTS

Outcomes can be capricious. Growing attached to specific outcomes can end in frustration and result in the negation of your efforts. Some failures lead to pleasing or helpful outcomes, while some successes create undesired results or consequences.

This is the "yes" and "no" of existence playing out within a d20 die roll. It is a microcosm that shows us a similar universal actor in our daily lives. We don't know why, but sometimes the result of something is NO. Sometimes, the result is YES. The "yes" and "no" are also constantly changing. As a human bound by linear awareness, you typically lack the long-term or consistent non-linear awareness of geologic or cosmic time needed to see why the probability curve bends the way it does. This realization can either be upsetting or comforting. 5eFP encourages you to see this as comforting.

A flood of non-linear awareness sunders your equilibrium with a barrage of perplexing and confusing information that can interfere with and overly complicate daily life's already complicated and challenging experience. Awareness like this can do little to support a life harmonized within human society and the world's linear existence. An effect may precede its cause in our non-linear existence, but this realization does little to achieve goals, win arguments ethically, and push through adversity and the resistance of others to see the other side of a conflict.

## Character Creation

You created your character since birth, and you continue to create your character when you wake up to each new day. Your character in RL is a part of you and, despite appearances, isn't rigidly defined. Your character is a mutable quality. Are there parts of your character that you need to work on? Are there parts of your character that no longer serve your life? Are there qualities that you long for and wish to include within your life?

When you create a new character, pick one aspect of yourself facing the challenge of unfavorable circumstances and assign it to the new character. The PC holds the post and wears the mantle of this challenge for you during that character's experience in the game. You may be overwhelmed by the number of aspects that challenge you. Return your focus to choosing the most central aspect that may even have more aspects revolving or orbiting around it. It isn't difficult to find those aspects that produce pain, aversion, aggression, fear, or worry. Our world rarely allows us to simply feel into them and become more aware of what they bring to the table. You will have plenty of time to explore additional challenging aspects as you wade into the depths of this practice.

You aren't just the challenging aspects that confront you. You also identify at least two talents within your life, two aptitudes, and one average ability. Try to be as honest with yourself as you can be when assigning ability scores. Your character can be an idealized version of yourself with more capacity than you feel. This is OK and encouraged while playing your character and the game. It can be challenging to see our positive qualities through the cloud of unfavorable circumstances. Even if you don't readily identify with these talents and aptitudes, allow your PC to have them while being curious about where those qualities are in your RL body. You may journal your sense of what your real ability scores are without censoring or revising your answers and revisit this inner awareness while you level your PC within the practice. Notice when the aspects are aligned and when the aspects are not attuned to you.

## Obscuring Map Tiles

These opaque tiles represent your conflict on a personal and embodied level. You reach out, take the opaqueness in your hand as a beloved friend, turn it over to determine whether or not it hid an encounter on its underside, and then return it to the supply of obscuring map tiles. Often, you must confront and address your conflict or crisis, facing what arises within yourself and your life as you do so. You don't know what you will find once you have decided to face your conflict or crisis, but the healing process will never be complete unless you do so.

The map begins completely obscured. The conflict or crisis feels overwhelming and overpowering at first, both in life and when you begin the game. Over time, this lessens, replaced by a growing sense of free agency, playfulness, lightness of being, and gratitude as more and more of the conflict is cleared, making known to you what the conflict obscured and eclipsed all along.

## Insight in Real Life

Insight always begins with us, the individual parts of our society or assembly which collectively form the whole of humanity. There are endless opportunities for deepening your Insight within yourself. Any _surplus_ Insight pours forth from you once you have received your fill. Insights have more to do with ourselves than the other person, movement, event, or interaction being witnessed. You can spend a lifetime dedicated to Insight and still have something left to learn about yourself. Turn the eyes of the heart inward. Become curious about what is arising within you.

## Medicine in Real Life

Finding balance in your work, life, health, and wellness is crucial, but the world's distractions can throw you off your center. So, we must continually dedicate time to healing. Some wounds are easier to dress than others. You may need to deal with deeper wounds before healing a wound closer to the surface. Putting in consistent effort over months or even years helps you understand your wounds and what you need for stabilization. The healing process requires courage and curiosity; it's often not a straightforward path and may involve unexpected support. Having a guide can make healing faster. Additionally, your healing depends on your willingness to explore parts of yourself that you may have ignored, overlooked, or rejected.

## Perception in Real Life

Perception begins with perceiving your physical, earthly body and immediate surroundings. This awareness helps you interrelate with others and navigate life's changes. Witnessing your feelings, thoughts, and instincts as information lets you learn about your reactions. The more you know about yourself, the less you identify with the reactions of others.

## Performance in Real Life

Developing healthy growth and skills takes time. Some are easy to acquire, while others take longer. Dedication to Performance enhances efficiency as it focuses your efforts. This dedication also encourages you to let go of the old and familiar narratives that identify you with what no longer serves your life. Changing the narrative and deciding to be successful improves your chances of reaching your goals. Recognize your limits in pursuing growth and goals since your body has needs, physical limitations, and capacities that cannot be ignored. Cultivating growth involves recognizing and healing wounds, releasing old patterns, practicing gratitude, and nurturing self-acceptance. Individuals dedicated to Performance progress better due to their commitment to improvement and allocating time for necessary tasks, followed by taking essential steps toward success.

## Survival in Real Life

Survival starts with recognizing that you don’t have all the answers and that achieving goals requires embracing the unknown and the courage to get lost once in a while. While plans and routes are important, adaptability is needed to navigate unexpected events. Dedicating Survival can help lead you to undiscovered paths and solutions. Focus on your goals but remain receptive to what life brings, as it may hold the necessary answers. Arriving (somewhere) or receiving (something) might require you to first surrender to not knowing exactly how you will arrive or how you will receive. You don't need to know how it will happen to receive the benefits it provides.

# Introduction

The Five Energies Focus Practice (5eFP) is a tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) that combines fun and immersive gameplay with deepening levels of self-exploration. 5eFP can be played for fun, self-reflection, mindfulness, or all three. 5eFP's dedication and inspiration rules are system-agnostic and can be used with any TRPG.

_**Five Energies.**_ 5eFP is based on and inspired by the D20 fifth edition rules, which condenses all traditional D20 fifth edition skills into five essentials universal to all TRPGS: Insight, Medicine, Perception, Performance, and Survival. Skills are energies we use to affect change in the 5eFP game and real life (RL). Five Energies also refers to five elemental qualities: earth, water, fire, air, and aether.

_**Focus.**_ Learning and gaining proficiency requires focus, time, and attention. Focus begins with cultivating greater awareness of thoughts, feelings, and instincts as sensations arise within the body. Reaching the next level of experience brings about greater awareness and deeper access to life's energy sourced from within ourselves.

_**Practice.**_ Focus alone isn't enough. Results require real doing through regular and consistent gameplay. We transform TRPGs into mindful practices. Practices are activities we return to because they feed us in some way. Successful practices provide a nutrient missing in other activities. Our practice is regularly playing 5eFP games from beginning to end, fully conscious and aware at least once per month.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Consent in gaming.** 5eFP uses consent in gaming to promote a safe space for players to explore themselves through the characters they play and the game world their characters interact with. Infighting, backstabbing, or disharmonious behavior between payers is prohibited.

2. **Collaboration and Trust.** Game Masters (GMs) and player characters (PCs) work together to create an enjoyable narrative. Story elements arise during gameplay, with GMs generating ideas while PCs can also contribute. Trust and collaboration among players enhance the experience. In 5eFP, GMs excel at storytelling, providing structure and guiding decisions to keep the story engaging and consistent.
3. **No compulsion.** 5eFP is an at-will TRPG where you can join or leave practices freely, without coercion. Rejoining is not allowed once you leave a practice, but you can join a different one. Benefits are gained only from active participation. These games foster a pressure-free environment for self-reflection and personal growth; your GM and fellow players cannot control your game experience.
4. **Not just another TRPG.** 5eFP GMs hold the center for all players within their practice, requiring cultivated skills and capacities that demand resources and energy to sustain. Any admission fees related to joining a 5eFP practice are non-refundable.
5. **Guidance.** 5eFP is designed to support players with their existing counselors, therapists, teachers, and guides. It’s recommended that players ally with guides for self-reflection, as humans often fall into self-deceit. The content generated during 5eFP sessions can serve as material for discussion with these guides, who can also suggest suitable gameplay explorations. One goal of 5eFP is to foster these collaborative relationships.
6. **Therapeutic but _not therapy_.** 5eFP games can be therapeutic by revealing hidden parts of ourselves. Taking brief notes during the game is important, as these sessions are not therapy, and your GM won’t pause to process them. Players adapt and integrate experiences spontaneously. At the end of the session, there will be time for journaling, and further processing can occur later with a guide or teacher.

# A New Way to Play

5eFP is different from other TRPGs. While many of its game features are based on the D20 fifth edition rules, 5eFP's versions are simplified and restructured to create a new set of rules outlined in this section. These rules were created to promote a game that can be set up and taken down like a board game and as a modular game whose pieces can be used repeatedly and consistently. Players will find that the action revolves around a typical in-game day, which begins after gaining the benefits of a long rest and involves choosing and deploying onto the world map to complete game objectives. GMs and PCs are strongly encouraged to review the 5eFP game differences before moving on to other sections, such as character creation or creating a setting handbook.

## Game Terms

### World Map

The world map drives the game's story and content. It is a top-down illustration of the game world or region divided into a 14-square by 14-square grid. Each square within the grid is measured 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters. The map contains (9) 2x2 world map tiles for each cardinal direction, (3) 2x2 world map tiles for each hybrid ordinal direction, and (1) 2x2 HQ tile. A road, path, or trail divides hybrid world map tiles in two parts from the SW corner to the NE corner and shares characteristics found on adjacent world map tile directions.

**Removing Obscuring Tiles.** Before you move onto a map tile covered by an obscuring tile, turn over the obscuring tile. The underside of an obscuring tile may display one of several possible icons.
- **Red Orb or Solid Red Circle.** The obscuring tile covered a foothold (see _Foothold_ below).
- **White Orb or Solid White Circle.** The obscuring tile covered a setting handbook requirement (see _Setting Handbook_ below).
- **Campfire Icon or Solid Gold Circle.** The obscuring tile covered a campfire encounter (TBD).
- **Bag Icon or Solid Green Circle.** The obscuring tile covered an area rich with resources (TBD).

Once you have turned over the obscuring map tile and determined the results of any revealed icons, you then discard the obscuring tile and move on to the revealed map tile. If the obscuring map tile revealed a foothold, you set up the foothold before moving onto it. Note the cardinal direction you used to move onto the foothold from the world map. The party then enters the foothold from the opposite direction used to enter it unless the foothold describes a designated starting area.

### Story Directions and Elements

**Story Directions.** The world map has four cardinal directions: North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W). Each cardinal direction is linked to unique story elements corresponding to that direction. There are also four ordinal or hybrid directions: Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE), Southwest (SW), and Northwest (NW). Each hybrid direction is linked to the story elements within adjacent cardinal directions.

**Story Elements.** Story elements can be thought of as pieces of the overall story relating to the conflict detailed in your setting handbook modified by the particular direction the PCs are exploring. Over time, these story elements automatically create stories of their own. GMs and PCs don't necessarily need to control how these elements emerge, though GMs may choose to adjust them with player consent so they fit together better.

You reveal a story element by drawing one from a story direction deck or rolling a random result on a story direction roll table. If a story element is revealed in a hybrid direction, you reveal a story element for each adjacent direction.

A story direction is typically summarized with short descriptive phrases such as (N) Lonely Wood, (W) Haunted Moors, (E) Sunken Temple, and so on.

For example, while exploring NE, the PCs reveal a foothold. Because they are exploring a hybrid direction, they reveal one story element from both directions. They reveal a _withered copse_ from (N) Lonely Wood and _swampy ruins_ from (E) Sunken Temple. They continue to draw story elements from both adjacent directions until they reveal an encounter. In this case, they reveal a _windswept glade_ from Lonely Wood and get the _merrow encampment_ monster encounter from the Sunken Temple direction. Since they drew an encounter, they stopped drawing more story elements. The GM and PCs discard the _windswept glade_ story element because they don't feel as much interest in it and keep the _withered copse_ and the _swampy ruins_. They then decide together that the party is in a transition area between the Lonely Wood and where the land sinks away toward the Sunken Temple. They then determine that the party can see a withered copse near a _merrow encampment_, and the whole area has a scattering of mysterious ruins sinking into the swamp.

### Foothold

A foothold is a concentrated local event related to the conflict detailed in your setting handbook (see _Setting Handbook_ below). PCs must find and resolve three footholds to finish exploring an obscured world map tile.

A foothold is a region on the world map containing an encounter that challenges the PCs somehow. The GM draws or rolls for a story element from the direction the PCs are exploring, continuing to draw and roll story elements until revealing an encounter. PCs choose and add one story element to the encounter from those revealed, discarding any remaining story elements. If the PCs encounter a foothold while exploring a hybrid tile, they keep two story elements (one from each adjacent direction) instead of picking only one story element.

### Headquarters (HQ)

Each world map has a headquarters, usually located at the center of the world map. HQ represents the central organization or organizing force responsible for maintaining the health and security of the game world or region. All PCs are peers and colleagues within this organization. You are objectively safe from the conflict at HQ, provided HQ's upkeep costs are maintained (see _Setting Handbook_ below).

### Fast Travel

5eFP games use fast travel rules when deploying onto the world map, skipping past traveling and travel times.

### Recall

PCs are transported back to HQ after performing a Recall ritual outside of an encounter. PCs automatically Recall 8 hours after deploying onto the world map.

### Setting Handbook

All details about the 5eFP practice you are joining can be found in your setting handbook. The following information is contained within.
- **World Map.** GMs and PCs will find a section illustrating the game world or region before the conflict begins and a summary of the game's setting. The world map begins covered with obscuring map tiles, which PCs remove when they explore an obscured map tile. The requirements for exploring an obscured map tile are detailed here.
- **HQ.** Details about HQ's organization or organizing force and the role PCs play within it can be found here.
- **Conflict.** 5eFP games have a conflict section detailing the central crisis or unfavorable circumstances that have transformed the game world or region into an unbalanced and afflicted state. The conflict cannot be resolved at LEVEL 1. Resolving the conflict requires completing a prerequisite at LEVEL 7, which is detailed in this section. Any changes to game features related to the conflict will also be documented here.
- **Story Directions.** The four cardinal story directions are revealed here.
- **Fast Travel.** How fast travel is achieved in your game is explained here.
- **Recall.** How you Recall in your game is explained here, including any special equipment or game features linked to your ability to Recall. 

The following procedure must be completed to explore a world map tile:
- Explore 55% or more of the map.
- Find and resolve 3 footholds.
- Locate an item or complete a setting handbook requirement.

Steps taken for world map deployment.
1. **Preview.** Druids and rangers receive a special bonus round. Each druid and ranger PC, in initiative order, may choose one unexplored world map tile within the current level of play and preview its terrain by temporarily removing its obscuring world map tile. Once finished, the player then returns the obscuring world map tile back to its original position.
2. **Selection.** The PCs, as a group, choose a cardinal or ordinal direction and trace a path from the HQ tile along the map until an obscured world map tile is encountered within the current level of play. This becomes the selected world map tile.
3. **Prepare.** Players may choose to spend 1 round of preparation before deploying. See "Preparation."
4. **Setup.** Place an empty (22 x 22) exploration map beside the world map. Roll a d20 onto the exploration map before placing any tiles and note the location of where the dice lands. This determines the starting position for the PCs.
5. **Deploy.** The GM reveals the starting map tile on the exploration map at the starting position determined in the previous step, placing the group token onto it.
6. **Choose Party Token Controller.** PCs appoint one player as the group token controller. This player can be the party leader, but this is not required. The PC with the most overland movement bonuses is typically the group token controller. Some background, species, and class features provide significant bonuses while controlling the group token during the exploration phase.
7. **Move the group token.** The group token controller moves the token, lifting any obscuring tiles encountered along the way. Removing an obscuring tile may reveal one of several potential world map features called footholds:
    - Dungeons
    - Creatures
    - Villages or settlements
    - Buildings
    - Treasures
    - Traps
    - Specific features or items necessary for completion as outlined in your setting handbook.

### Setting Handbook Requirement

TBA

### LEVEL

LEVEL is a placeholder representing the level of your 5eFP game. LEVEL initially starts at 1 and increases as game objectives are completed.

### Short Rest

Unless otherwise stated in your setting handbook, you can complete up to two short rests per game session. When you finish a short rest, you first receive a number of healing points equal to LEVEL. Then, any additional game features that activate during a short are resolved.

> What happened to the long rest?
>> 5eFP does not use long rest rules.

# Character Creation

**Ability Scores**

Whenever you create a new character, assign ability scores using the standard array: (+2, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1)

Choose and place each score as desired. Two ability scores represent advanced ability and talent (+2), another two represent aptitude (+1), another ability score represents average ability (+0), and the last ability score is challenged by adversity and unfavorable circumstances (-1).

### Round Down
Certain features and effects in the game allow you to divide a number by half or more. Whenever you divide a number, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

# Species

## Species Traits

The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one character’s ability score by +1. Most species also grant another improved ability score that gains an additional +1 if you assign a +1 or greater score during character creation.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Your speed represents the maximum number of squares you can move during your turn.

### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Varieties
Some species have one or more varieties. Each variety has the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their variety. Relationships among varieties differ significantly from species to species and world to world.

## Dwarf

### Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution (CON) score increases by +1.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares. Heavy armor does not reduce your speed.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on ability checks against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Stonecunning.** You roll all ability checks used to determine the origin of stonework with advantage.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

### Hill Dwarf

As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or greater to your Wisdom score (WIS) during character creation, increase your WIS by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Toughness**. Your MAX wounds increase by +1.

### Highlander Dwarf

As a highlander dwarf, you are accustomed to rugged living at high altitudes and within mountain dwellings.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 greater to your Strength score (STR) during character creation, increase your STR by an additional +1.

**Dwarven Armor Training.** You gain light and medium armor proficiency.

## Elf

### Elf Traits

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, a result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score (DEX) increases by +1.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Keen Senses.** You gain advantage on WIS checks to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on ability checks against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### High Elf

As a high elf, you have strong ties to nature and magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other species.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or greater to your Intelligence score (INT) during character creation, increase your INT by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Magic Attunement.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- **Arcane.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. INT is your spellcasting ability for it. You can also speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
- **Feywild.** You can cast the *misty step* spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
- **Shadowfell.** You can cast the *faerie fire* spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

### Wealden Elf

As a wealden elf, you have deep awareness and intuition, and your attunement to nature carries you quickly and stealthily through natural terrain. Wealden elves tend to be reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or greater to your Wisdom score (WIS) during character creation, increase your WIS by an additional +1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Expeditious.** Your base speed increases by +1 square whenever you move through at least one square of natural terrain (arctic,	coast,	desert,	forest, grassland,	mountain,	or	swamp).

**Naturemeld.** At the beginning of each of your turns, if you start your turn on natural terrain (arctic,	coast,	desert,	forest, grassland,	mountain,	or	swamp), you gain advantage on DEX checks until the beginning of your next turn.

## Halfling

### Halfling Traits

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score (DEX) increases by +1.

**Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

**Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 5 squares.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll or ability check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Brave.** You have advantage on ability checks against fear effects.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Lightfoot

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other species or take up a nomadic life.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or greater to your Charisma score (CHA) during character creation, increase your CHA by an additional +1.

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

### Hardy

Hardy halflings are tougher than average, sharing similar characteristics with dwarves. Their tribes can be found in remote areas or near dwarven clans, though some do make their way to civilized lands.

**Ability Score Increase.** If you assign a +1 or greater to your Constitution score (CON) during character creation, increase your CON by an additional +1.

**Resilience.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- Your MAX wounds increases by +1.
- You have advantage on ability checks against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

## Human

### Human Traits

It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by +1.

**Adaptable.** Choose and gain one species trait:
- Choose an ability score unmodified by your ability score increase trait. The chosen ability score increases by +1.
- You gain one feat. ~~Additionally, choose an ability. Ability checks with the chosen ability gain advantage.~~

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

# Healers

Healers are generally good combatants with features that protect and heal themselves and others.

## Cleric

#### Class Features

As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

#### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

**Abilities:** Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA)

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (*a*) a mace or (*b*) a warhammer (if proficient)
- (*a*) scale mail or (*b*) leather armor or (*c*) chainmail (if proficient)
- (*a*) a light crossbow and bolts or (*b*) any simple weapon

#### Spellcasting

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. 

#### Cantrips

You know three cleric cantrips of your choice.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to WIS + LEVEL (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at headquarters (HQ). While away from HQ, you can prepare a new list of cleric spells by completing a short rest in prayer or meditation.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity, a dedication, such as those listed in the dedication rules, or an elemental quality. You use your WIS whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Divine Domain

Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Medicine. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features.

#### Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of domain spells. You always have domain spells prepared and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare while at HQ or during a short rest.

If you gain a domain spell that isn't a cleric spell, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### Medicine Domain

The Medicine domain focuses on vibrant positive energy that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

#### Medicine Domain Spells

- bless
- cure wounds

#### Bonus Proficiency

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.

#### Performance Medicine

Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to give a creature 1 or more points of healing, the creature receives one additional point of healing per spell level.

## Paladin

#### Class Features

As	a	paladin,	you	gain	the	following	class	features.

#### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 4 + Constitution (CON)

#### Proficiencies

- (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
- (a) javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
- (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
- Chain mail and a holy symbol

### Divine Sense

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 12 squares of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + CHA. You regain all expended uses whenever you return to Headquarters (HQ).

### Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a reserve of healing power that replenishes at the end of a game session. You can assign up to 5 points of healing with your reserve.

As an action, you can touch a wounded creature and spend 1 or more points of healing, up to the maximum amount remaining in your reserve. The creature receives the healing.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 points from your reserve to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

# Mages

Mages are generally spellcasters or versatile specialists with more mental and less physical training.

- Leather armor, and an explorer's pack

### Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful (DC 15) WIS check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

#### Cantrips

You know two druid cantrips of your choice.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to WIS + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your WIS whenever a druid spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use WIS when setting the DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + WIS

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips

You know four sorcerer cantrips of your choice.

#### Spell Slots

You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots at the end of the game session.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _burning hands_ and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast _burning hands_ using either slot.

#### Spells Known

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Sorcerous Origin

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, such as Draconic Bloodline. Your choice grants you additional features.

### Draconic Bloodline

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor

Choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

**Draconic	Ancestry**
| Dragon | Damage	Type |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, you gain advantage on CHA checks while interacting with dragons.

#### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your MAX wounds increases by +1.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + DEX.

## Warlock

#### Class Features

As a warlock, you gain the following class features.

#### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

- (a) a light crossbow and bolts or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

#### Otherworldly Patron

You are in the service of an otherworldly being of your choice: the Fey, the Celestial, or the Primordial each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features.

#### Pact Magic

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips

You know two warlock cantrips of your choice.

#### Spell Slots

You begin the game with one 1st level spell slot. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _burning hands_ and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast _burning hands_ using either slot.

#### Spells Known

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

Whenever you successfully upgrade a Magic feature (i.e., "Magic I", "Magic II", "Magic III", etc.), you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells,	so you use your CHA whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your CHA when setting the DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

## Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and abilities and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### The Primordial

You have made a pact with a powerful elemental from within the Primordial Chaos, the home plane of existence for all elementals. Your primordial patron is strictly neutral in outlook and temperament, swayed only by their attunement to a specific elemental quality. Earth tends to be steady, tenacious, and indomitable. Water tends to be flexible and aware. Fire tends to be activating, charged, and focused. Air tends to be expansive and mobile. Primordials rarely involve themselves in mortal affairs or circumstances unless the elemental balance is threatened somehow. Such beings desire the propagation of the elements and their elemental outlook upon the prime material plane through you, their chosen vessel. Primordials powerful enough to forge a pact and their preferred elemental outlook include Phoneix (fire), Leviathan (water), Zaratan (earth), and Elder Tempest (air).

#### Expanded Spell List

The Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

**PRIMORDIAL EXPANDED SPELLS**
|||
|:-:|:-:|
|Spell Level|Spells|
|1st|Burning Hands, Thunderwave|
|2nd|Acid Arrow, Flaming Sphere|
|3rd|Fireball, Lightning Bolt|
|4th|Conjure Minor Elementals, Wall of Fire|
|5th|Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold|
|6th|Chain Lightning, Freezing Sphere|
|7th|Delayed Blast Fireball, Prismatic Spray|
||
|Paragon|Control Weather, Incendiary Cloud|
|Epic|Gate, Prismatic Wall|

### Elemental Attunement

Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to shift and adapt elemental energies within the spells you cast from the Primordial expanded spell list. Whenever you cast a spell from the Primordial expanded spell list that deals energy damage, you may choose to replace the energy type with the type preferred by your patron (Phoenix: fire, Laviathon: cold, Zaraton: acid, and Elder Tempest: lightning).

Spells affected by this feature lose any secondary effects. For example, a cold _fireball_ no longer ignites combustibles within the spell's area of effect. Similarly, an acid _thunderwave_ does not push creatures or unsecured objects and no longer generates a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

## Wizard

#### Class Features

As a wizard, you gain the following class features.

#### Health

**MAX Wounds:** 3 + Constitution (CON)

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows

**Tools:** None

**Abilities:** Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS)

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
- A spellbook

#### Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

#### Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

#### Spellbook

You have a spellbook containing six 1st-­level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

You begin the game with two 1st level spell slots. To cast one of your spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your INT + the number of Magic upgrades you've unlocked (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a wizard who has upgraded Magic three times, you have four 1st-­level and two 2nd-­level spell slots. With an INT of +3, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-­level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-­level or a 2nd-­level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells at HQ. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability

INT is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,	since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your INT whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your INT when setting the DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell DC** = 10 + INT

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + INT

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you complete a Spells upgrade, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

#### Arcane Recovery

Studying your spellbook taught you to regain some of your magical energy. Once per game session, you can choose expended spell slots to recover when you finish a short rest. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than your wizard level, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 2nd-­level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-­level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

> #### Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
> 
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 1⛁. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and coin, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
> 
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
> 
> ***The Book’s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration.

**Spell DC** = 10 + CHA

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + CHA

### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Magic Performance

Your bardic magic lets you use your voice or any instrument you wield more effectively. You roll with advantage whenever you make CHA checks with your voice or an instrument you're welding.

### Bardic Action Dice

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 10 squares of you who can hear you. That creature gains three of your action dice.

For the remainder of the encounter, the creature can roll any of your action dice and add the result to one ability check or attack roll it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use any of your action dice but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once your action dice are rolled, they are returned to you. If the creature has one or more of your action dice and gains more, it decides whether to keep the ones it has or gain the new ones. Any discarded action dice are returned to you.

You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your CHA (minimum 1).

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

Expertise allows you to add your level to a check twice instead of once.

### Sneak Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra +1 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 1 square of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Thieves’ Cant

During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

# Beyond 1st Level

Players gain experience by discovering and resolving world map tiles. When all tiles in the current level of play are discovered and resolved, the next level of play on the world map unlocks and players advance to the next level. This is called gaining a level.

When your character gains a level, you can spend Coin to gain additional features available to your background, class, or species. These features are detailed in the background, class, and species descriptions below. Some of these features allow you to increase one ability score by +1.

### Level 1 Class Upgrades

BARBARIAN
||||
|-:|:-|:-|
|**Cost**|**Feature**|**Details**|
|2⛁|Reckless Attack|...|
|2⛁|Danger Sense|You gain advantage to DEX checks vs. effects you can see|
|2⛁|Primal Path|Path of the Berserker|
|3⛁|Rage I|+1 rage/day|

> #### Reckless Attack
>> You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce determination.
>> 
>> When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on weapon attack rolls using STR during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
>> 
> #### Path of the Berserker
>> For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-­being.
>> 
>> **_Frenzy._** You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in Appendix PH-­A).

BARD

|-:|:-|:-|
|**Cost**|**Feature**|**Details**|
|2⛁|Jack of All Trades|Add half your level (minimum 1) to nonproficient ability checks|
|2⛁|Song of Rest|You and your allies receive 1 point of healing at the end of a short rest|
|2⛁|Spells I|(+1) known spell, (+1) 1st-level spell slot|

|3⛁|Expertise|...|
|3⛁|Spells II|(+1) known spell, (+1) 1st-level spell slot, (+2) 2nd-level spell slots|

> #### College of Lore
>> Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
>> 
>> The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
>> 
>> The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-­important figures of authority.
>> 
>> **_Bonus Proficiencies._** You gain proficiency with one ability of your choice.
>> 
>> **_Cutting Words._** You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 12 squares of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of bardic action dice, rolling three action dice and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.
>
> #### Expertise
>> Gain proficiency with a nonproficient ability of your choice. Then choose two of your ability proficiencies or one of your ability proficiencies and your proficiency with a tool. As long as the chosen proficiencies or tools do not already have expertise, you gain expertise in the chosen abilities or tools. Expertise allows you to add your level to a check twice instead of once.

|2⛁|Divine Domain Feature|...|
|3⛁|Spells I|(+1) 1st-level spell slot, (+2) 2nd-level spell slots|

> #### Channel Divinity (1/rest)
>> You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
>>
>> When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require ability checks. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell DC.
>> 
>> **_Turn Undead. (action)_** You present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you must make a WIS check. If the creature fails its check, it is turned for the rest of the encounter or until it takes any damage.
>>
>> A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>> 
> #### Divine Domain Feature
>> MEDICINE
>> 
>> **_Preserve Life. (action)_** You present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can provide up to 5 points of healing. Choose any creatures within 6 squares of you, and divide the healing among them. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

|3⛁|Spells II|(+1) 1st-level spell slot, (+2) 2nd-level spell slots|

> #### Wild Shape (action)
>> You magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. When you use this feature, save and set aside any wounds and choose a wild shape form. Use statistics for an elite creature except as detailed below. Your wild shape form cannot benefit from any swim or fly speeds it may have.
>> 
>> WILD SHAPE FORMS
>>> **_Astral._** You have 1 + LEVEL MAX wounds while in astral form. When you choose this form, you do not assume the shape of a beast. You remain in your normal form while gaining a number of additional features. Your form becomes translucent, taking on an indigo tint filled with points of moving lights.
>>>> **_Lunar Attunement._** Whenever you cast a spell that has no visible effect (i.e., _cure wounds_), you lose solar attunement and gain lunar attunement. If you already have lunar attunement, remove lunar attunement and activate _starfall_ (see below).
>>>> 
>>>> **_Solar Attunement._** Whenever you cast a spell that has a visible effect (i.e., _entangle_), you lose lunar attunement and gain solar attunement. If you already have solar attunement, remove solar attunement and activate _starfall_ (see below).
>>>> 
>>>> **_Starfall. (free action)_** A shooting star of radiance forms above your head and strikes a creature within 12 squares of you. If the creature is friendly, it receives 1 point of healing and allows the creature to make one additional ability check to resist one ongoing negative effect. If the creature is not a friendly target, it must succeed on a DEX check using your spell DC or take 1 point of radiant damage. You then gain Lunar Attunement or Solar Attunement.
>>> 
>>> **_Defender._** You have 5 + LEVEL MAX wounds while in defender form. While in defender form, you can Bolster (LEVEL) without spending an action when you assume this wild shape form and at the beginning of each of your turns.
>>> 
>>> **_Stealthy._** You have 4 + LEVEL MAX wounds while in stealthy form. While in stealthy form, you roll DEX and WIS checks with advantage and gain a pounce attack (if you don't already have one).
>>>
>>>> **Pounce.** If the stealthy form moves at least 3 squares straight toward a creature and then hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 STR check or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the stealthy form can make one melee attack against it as a bonus action.
>>> 
>>> **_Travel._** To activate this feature, you must be on the overland map (see _Overland Map_) and not in a combat encounter. You have 1 MAX wounds while in travel form. When activated, you and any chosen creatures within 6 squares of you transform into travel forms and move together. If a combat encounter begins or if 1 or more points of damage are dealt to you or another affected creature, your wild shape and all travel forms end. Your movement score doubles while in travel form. Once activated while on the overland map, the travel form can be reactivated on the overland map outside of a combat encounter at any time until the end of the game session.
>> 
>> You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short rest.
>>
>> You can stay in a wild shape form until you return to the HQ map room. You then revert to your normal form. If your wild shape form ends early you can activate wild shape again to maintain your current form, as long as you have enough uses of the feature remaining. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, gain MAX wounds, or die.
>>
>> While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
>> - Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the wild shape form, but you retain your alignment, personality, and INT, WIS, and CHA. You also retain all of your proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
>> - When you transform, you assume the wild shape form's MAX wounds. When you revert to your normal form, you return all wound cards you set aside before you transformed. However, if you revert because your wild shape form gained MAX Wounds, any excess wounds carry over to your normal form. For example, if you take 2 damage in a wild shape form and have room for only 1 wound, you revert and take 1 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t cause you to reach your maximum wounds, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
>> - You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your wild shape form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as _call lightning_, that you’ve already cast. You may cast spells, speak, and take normal actions while in astral form.
>> - You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as truesight, unless your new form also has that sense.
>> - You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
>
> #### Druid Circle
>> You choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land.
>> 
>>> Circle of the Land
>>> 
>>> The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.
>>>
>>> **_Bonus Cantrip._** When you choose this circle, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.
>>> 
>>> **_Natural Recovery._** You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to your level, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
>>>
>>> For example, when you are a 2nd-­level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-­level slot or two 1st-level slots.
>>>
>>> **_Circle Spells._** Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. You gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.
>>>
>>> Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

|3⛁|Martial Archetype|...|

> #### Action Surge
>> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
>>
>> Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
>>  
> #### Martial Archetype
>> You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you additional features.
>>
>>> **_Champion._** The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

|3⛁|Monastic Tradition|...|
|3⛁|Deflect Missiles|...|

> #### Ki
>> Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. You have 1 + LEVEL ki points.
>>
>> You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.
>>
>> When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short rest or until the end of the game session, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend half the short rest meditating to regain your ki points.
>>
>> Some of your ki features require your target to make an ability check to resist the feature’s effects. The ki DC is calculated as follows:
>>
>> **Ki DC** = 10 +  WIS
>>
>> **Flurry of Blows.** Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
>>
>> **Patient Defense.** You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
>>
>> **Step of the Wind.** You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.
>>
> #### Unarmored Movement
>> Your speed increases by 2 while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
>> 
> #### Monastic Tradition
>> You commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features.
>>
>>> **Way of the Open Hand.** Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.
>>>
>>>> **Open Hand Technique.** You can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
>>>> - It must succeed on a DEX check or be knocked prone.
>>>> - It must make a STR check. If it fails, you can push it up to 3 squares away from you.
>>>> - It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
>>
> #### Deflect Missiles
>> You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the piece of ammunition or missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1 + DEX + your level (minimum 0).
>>
>> If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 4 squares and a long range of 12 squares.

|**Cost**|**Feature**|**Details**|
|2⛁|Font of Magic|...|

> #### Font of Magic
>> You tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
>>
>>> **Sorcery Points.** You have 2 sorcery points. At the beginning of a game session, you regain all spent sorcery points.
>>>
>>> **Flexible Casting.** You can use your sorcery points to gain additional sorcerer spell slots, or sacrifice sorcerer spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.
>>>> **_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform 2 unexpended sorcery points into one 1st-level sorcerer spell slot as a bonus action on your turn.
>>>> 
>>>> Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes at the end of the game session.
>>>> 
>>>> **_Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one 1st-level sorcerer spell slot and gain 1 sorcery point.

> #### Metamagic
>> You gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
>>
>> You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
>>
>> **_Careful Spell._** When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make an ability check, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your CHA (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its ability check against the spell.
>>
>> **_Distant Spell._** When you cast a spell that has a range of 1 square or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.
>> When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 6 squares.
>>
>> **_Empowered Spell._** When a spell deals damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase the spell damage by +1.
>>
>> You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
>>
>> **_Extended Spell._** When you cast a spell that has a duration of encounter, you can spend 1 sorcery point to extend its duration to the current game session.
>>
>> **_Heightened Spell._** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make an ability check to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first ability check made against the spell.
>>
>> **_Quickened Spell._** When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
>>
>> **_Subtle Spell._** When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
>>
>> **_Twinned Spell._** When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).
>>
>> To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, _magic missile_ and _scorching ray_ aren’t eligible, but _ray of frost_ is.

## Alignment
A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Player characters must select a non-evil alignment at character creation. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

> ### Playable Alignments
>> **GOOD.** Favors the common good for all. Fairness and consideration of others.
>> 
>> **LAWFUL.** Best able to turn chaos into a degree of order with purpose.
>> 
>> **CHAOTIC.** Best able to grow and adapt to changes.
>> 
>> **NEUTRAL.** Undecided. Understands that there is a time and place for each alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid species can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-­aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other species, though, made those species to serve them. Those species have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-­orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

## Languages
Your species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.

# Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the GM uses to reward you when you show up to play a game session on time and for playing your character in an exceptional way.

## Gaining Inspiration

At the beginning of each game session, PCs choose two different dedications from Insight, Medicine, Perception, Performance, or Survival (see _Dedications_ below). Once the choices are made, the chosen dedications can only be changed at the beginning of the next game session. Your GM then awards inspiration to all PCs who are physically present (if a player is remotely playing, they must be signed into the service and present within the chat session) in the current game session. Your GM also has the option to grant you inspiration for various reasons during gameplay. Generally, inspiration is given when you effectively portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM may introduce other ways to earn inspiration during the game. Your setting handbook may also introduce other ways to earn inspiration during the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can spend it when you roll to attack, resist a game feature, or otherwise perform an action. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll, allowing you to roll twice and keep the better result. Alternatively, you may spend your inspiration anytime to activate a dedication you made at the start of the game session.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Dedications

The following describes each dedication and how to use them in the game.

### Insight

Your insight imbues inward sight, granting vision beneath surface impressions.

Your GM reveals all the relevant hidden or obscured pieces of information in the current scene. Features granted through spell effects specifically designed to prevent sight, such as _invisibility_ or an equivalent effect, are not revealed; instead, their presence is confirmed, and you can sense the subtle flows of energy the spell displaces in its wake. This awareness lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

### Medicine

Your medicine stabilizes wounds.

Choose any number of creatures your character can see within 6 squares of you who are at MAX Wounds. The chosen creatures receive 1 point of healing.

> #### Other Game Systems
> Choose any number of creatures your character can see within 6 squares of you who are unconscious and dying. The selected creatures receive sufficient healing to stabilize their wounds, regain minimal health, and awaken, allowing them to take action on their next turn.
>
> 5eFP is forgiving around character death because the point of 5eFP is not to kill off all the PCs as fast as possible. Instead, it encourages _ongoing gameplay with familiar characters to engender a felt experience over time_. If your game has no grace period wherein PCs may recover from a deadly blow, then allow an inspired medicine to bring them back, but at the edge of death (one more hit will take them out again).

### Perception

Your perception enables you to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.

Your GM reveals all relevant information regarding the current scene gathered through the five senses (sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch).

### Performance

Your performance allows the satisfying completion of one action.

You decide the outcome of the next action your character declares on their turn. You must use your inspiration this way before taking an action or rolling any dice.

If the result of your chosen action further affects you on subsequent rounds during the same encounter, make all related die rolls with advantage.

> Your decision can only affect the outcome of that single action. If desired, you can add colorful descriptions of the action, particularly for critical hit damage. But your narrative can only affect that single action.
>
> For example, suppose you are in a combat encounter with goblins in a goblin lair. If you are deciding the outcome of an attack action against a goblin, your choices include a successful or unsuccessful hit. If an attack is successful, you choose the attack damage from 1 point, normal, or critical hit damage (double damage). You can also choose whether or not the goblin is knocked out if it reaches MAX Wounds. You cannot, however, add anything that would contradict the encounter, such as, "and then a secret door opens up on the cavern wall, revealing an exit passage into an underground garden area."
>
> While the secret door, exit, and underground garden area are creative and fascinating, they were not preestablished story elements before you took your action and cannot be inserted into the narrative of that action.
>
> Spells, skills, and game feature results must stay within the guidelines established in their rules. If a spell targets a creature with a die roll, you decide whether it is successful or not. If successful, you decide on the damage (if any) and the effect must match what that spell, skill, or game feature is capable of doing at the current level of play. You cannot add narrative elements that add or take away more.

>> Example 1:
>>> (_GM_) "The room opens up, exposing a sprawling cliff face leading to the top of the spire."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "I spend my inspiration on PERFORMANCE."
>>> 
>>> (_GM_) "OK, great. Tell us about what action your character wants to take. And then, when you're ready, tell us what happens."
>>> 
>>> (_Player 1_) "Thanks. Lita leaps onto the cliff face, finds her grip, and makes her way to the top."
>>> 
>> In example 1, _Player 1_'s action resolves a successful STR check without rolling to begin climbing the cliff face to reach the top of the spire, 40 squares above Lita's position. _Player 1 has indicated that this climb is important in some way_. While climbing the cliff, Lita makes all attacks and ability checks with advantage. Later, during the cliff-face encounter, Lita's skill is tested again due to strong winds. Lita must succeed on a STR check to hold onto the cliff. Lita rolls STR with advantage because she is still in the same cliff-face encounter.
>>
>> _Player 1_ may influence or affect the cliff-face narrative of an encounter but cannot end it with the inspired performance because the top of the cliff is 40 squares above Lita. Lita's movement speed is 3 squares while climbing. Without an alternative form of transportation, she can't reach the top in one round.
>>
>> Example 2: 
>>> _(GM)_ "Ok, it's your turn."
>>> 
>>> _(Player 2)_ "I spend my inspiration on PERFORMANCE."
>>> 
>>> _(GM)_ "OK, great. Tell us about what action your character wants to take. And then, when you're ready, tell us what happens."
>>> 
>>> _(Player 2)_ "Lita jumps out of the shadows where she's hiding and attacks the goblin, catching it off guard and unaware. She strikes with a critical hit, dealing maximum damage to the creature, adding her sneak attack damage."
>>> 
>> In example 2, _Player 2_'s action resolves a successful attack action from a hidden position and then finishes. The action does not continue on subsequent rounds.

### Survival

Your survival awards expanded capacities, allowing you to identify and acquire new advantages, qualities, or skills.

Activating survival allows you to reveal a game objective. Place a foothold or setting handbook requirement on a revealed square of your choice up to 2 squares away from you.

> **Other Game Systems**
>
>> When you use your dedication to activate survival, the GM indicates the direction and position (if within view) of your current focused objective on the map. For example, a player might activate inspired survival when faced with three mysterious doors. The GM reveals the door leading to the player's current quest. How your character ends up knowing this is connected with their class abilities, skills, and game features. Healers might receive divine inspiration to determine the result. Mages might use divination magic to determine the result. Scoundrels might use knowledge, cunning, or preternatural awareness to determine the result. Warriors might use knowledge, survival skills, or gut instincts to determine the result.

Alternatively, once per game session, when you spend your inspiration to activate Survival, you can instead choose to activate a dedication you didn't choose at the beginning of the current game session.

# Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your dwarf warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your halfling mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your elf scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with traits and important story cues about your character’s identity. Backgrounds describe all events leading up to joining a life of adventure. Your starting gear represents the implements and reagents typical of your chosen background. How did you learn the skills of your class? Refer to your setting handbook for potential answers to these questions.

~~The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?~~

The sample backgrounds presented here provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in "Equipment").

If your character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, choose a different tool proficiency instead.

### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by species. See “Languages.”

### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment.

### Feature
Background features unlock bonuses that may provide expanded options in HQ, additional choices during downtime rounds, added features while you are the group token controller, or access to otherwise restricted content.

## Acolyte

You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. Whenever you spend a downtime round at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, at the start of the downtime round, you gain ⛁ and holy water. Bonus coins awarded through this feature may only be spent on rest and repairs.

## Swindler

~~You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their heart's desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions, you can read them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage.~~

## Folk Hero

~~You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already, the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.~~

Your social status may be humble, but you have a greater purpose in life. The people of your village already view you as their champion, and you are called upon to confront the tyrants and monsters that endanger the common people everywhere.

Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

## Outlander

~~You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for m;iles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.~~

You have grown up in an environment far away from civilization and the conveniences of technology. You have observed the migration of herds larger than forests and survived weather conditions that city-dwellers would find hard to fathom. You have also enjoyed the peace and quiet of being the only sentient being for miles in any direction. The wilderness runs in your veins, whether you were a nomad, an adventurer, a hermit, a hunter-gatherer, or even a raider. Even in places where you are unfamiliar with the specific features of the landscape, you understand the ways of the wild.

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** A quarterstaff (staff), a hunting trap, a trophy (trinket) from an animal you hunted, and a belt pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Wanderer

While you are the party token controller, you reveal obscuring tiles up to 2 squares away provided you start your turn on natural terrain. You automatically detect and disarm any natural traps while moving the party token through natural terrain. You may set a natural trap during your round. You can only have 1 trap set this way per world map. When you use this feature to set a new trap, any previously set traps are removed. You may use this feature to place a foothold or an objective outlined within your setting handbook on an explored world map tile within 2 squares. Once you have used this feature in this way, you cannot do so again until the next game session.

## Scholar

~~You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your efforts have made you a master in your fields of study.~~

You devoted numerous years of your life to gaining knowledge about the multiverse. You meticulously scoured through manuscripts, delved into scrolls, and paid rapt attention to the leading authorities on subjects that fascinated you. As a result of your hard work, you have become an expert in your chosen areas of study.

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** Scholar's kit, alchemist's supplies, or navigator's tools; and a belt pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Researcher

Once during the downtime phase, before spending any ⛁, you gain ⛁ this round for research only. You may spend this ⛁ on any available research at any location. If there are no available research tracks, add one to any location and spend the bonus ⛁ on the added research.

## Seafarer

~~You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.~~

For years, you spent your time on a seafaring vessel, braving powerful storms, sea monsters, and enemies who sought to sink your ship to the bottom of the ocean. Although your passion has always been for the far-off horizon, you now feel the urge to venture out and try something different.

**Tool Proficiencies:** Navigator's tools, vehicles (water)

**Equipment:** Club (belaying pin), silk rope, gain a random trinket as a lucky charm, and a belt pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Ship's Passage

You gain the following features when HQ's docks are discovered.

Once during the downtime phase, you and up to 4 other PCs may complete one round of downtime onboard a ship in HQ's docks without spending any coin. Before the end of your downtime round, move the ship onto a different and accessible world map tile that shares the same terrain as HQ's docks. Ships return to HQ's dock at the end of the downtime round.

After deploying onto the world map, you may choose to deploy onboard your ship if the group token is on the same terrain as HQ's docks. Remove the group token from the world map and replace it with your ship token. Your ship token functions the same as a group token. While you are the group token controller onboard your ship, the ship gives you +1 speed, and you may remove obscuring tiles up to 2 squares away.

If your ship is adjacent to a world map tile that does not share terrain with HQ's docks, all players may choose to embark simultaneously from the ship, placing the group token on an adjacent world map tile that does not share terrain with HQ's docks. While the players embark, the ship no longer counts as a group token. All players can later board the ship simultaneously, removing the party token from the world map. Once players board the ship, the ship resumes as the group token.

Your ship returns to dock when you return to HQ.

## Soldier

~~War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, and learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army, a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.~~

You were trained at a young age for battle, learning how to handle weapons and armor, as well as basic survival skills.

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)

**Equipment:** An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger or trinket), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, and a belt pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Military Rank

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. Before deploying onto the world map, you gain a soldier minion under your command who deploys and returns to HQ alongside you. The soldier minion follows your commands to the best of its ability and allows you to remove 1 additional obscuring tile up to 2 squares away if you are the group token controller. If the soldier minion dies while deployed, remove it from the playing field. If your soldier minion did not die, you gain ⛁ at the start of the downtime phase.

## Street Rat

You grew up on the streets alone, fighting for survival every day. You had no family or financial support, slept in alleyways and on rooftops, and had to endure sickness without access to medicine. Despite all odds, you managed to survive by relying on your strength, speed, and cunning.

**Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, thieves' tools

**Equipment:** A dagger (small knife), a pet critter, a trinket to remember your parents (or guardians) by, and a belt pouch containing ⛁

### Feature: Streetwise

If you are the group token controller and you move through 1 or more squares with the city, dungeon, or road terrains, you gain +1 speed and may move through buildings and end your turn on a building (rooftop) as if they were roads. Buildings are considered difficult terrain. Your pet critter allows you to remove one additional obscuring map tile up to 2 squares away. Also, your party is never surprised when the group token is on a square with the building, city, dungeon, or road terrain.

# Equipment

## Coins

5eFP games use coins (**⛁** equals 1 coin), a single denomination representing wealth, resources, experience, and reputation. The name of a coin may change in some games. For example, coins might be called "gold pieces" in a medieval fantasy setting, while coins might refer to "credits" in a futuristic sci-fi setting. A game's setting handbook details what coins are called. All coins use the following rules.

## Earning Coins

GMs award **⛁** whenever PCs complete an encounter. Award an additional +⛁ if the PCs found one or more treasures during the encounter. Award an additional +⛁ if the PCs increased one or more reputations during the encounter.

The number of coins GMs award when encounters are completed increases to 2**⛁** starting at 3rd level and 3**⛁** beginning at 6th level.

### Spending Coins
PCs may spend coins during downtime (see Between Adventures) or during preparation (see Preparation) before deploying to a world map tile. PCs may spend any number of coins. Once a coin is spent, it is lost.

A game feature may temporarily grant PCs the ability to spend one or more coins. The feature explains when this happens and provides guidelines for how many coins a PC can choose to spend.

## Selling Treasure
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to HQ ~, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot~.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. This means you must sell two pieces of the same equipment in order to receive any coins.  Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond what simple coins represent and should always be treated as such. 

PCs may choose to create a magic item marketplace by unlocking this building through downtime research.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items are included in the description of coins. Coins do not differentiate between coins, gems, jewelry, and art for ease of use and simplicity.

**Trade Goods.** On the borderlands (the world map tiles furthest from HQ), many people conduct transactions through barter. Trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency. You may spend 1 or more trade goods as if they were an equivalent amount of ⛁ within the level 3 and level 6 areas. Spent trade goods are sent to the equipment discard pile.

## Armor
Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into four categories: cloth, leather, chain, and plate. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

***Armor Proficiency.*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check or attack roll that involves STR or DEX, and you can’t cast spells.

***Armor Class (AC).*** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your AC.

***Heavy Armor.*** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str +1” or “Str +2”, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 2 squares unless the wearer has a STR score equal to or higher than the listed score.

***Stealth.*** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage”, the wearer has disadvantage on DEX checks.

***Shields.*** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your DEX to your Armor Class.

***Padded.*** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

***Leather.*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

***Studded Leather.*** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-­set rivets or spikes.

### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your DEX, to a MAX DEX of +2, to your Armor Class.

***Breastplate.*** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

***Chain Mail.*** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

### Heavy Armor
***Plate.*** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

...

|:-|:-|
|No Armor|AC 10 + DEX|

|Medium Armor|AC 16 (STR +1 or greater), Max DEX +2|
|Heavy Armor|AC 18 (STR +2 or greater)|
|Shield|+2 AC|

|Full Plate|Disadvantage|12⛁|

Armor listed with disadvantage imposes disadvantage to any ability check used for quick, agile, and stealthy actions while the armor is equipped.

When wearing armor that is listed as having Max DEX +2, your Dexterity modifier can only modify your Armor Class (AC) by a maximum of +2. This means that if you have DEX +3 and you wear medium armor with Max DEX +2, you can only apply a +2 modifier to your AC, and the remaining +1 modifier is ignored.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
You may don or doff armor as part of completing a Rest (Short Rest).

## Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your LEVEL to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your LEVEL to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Ammunition is a special multi-use item. Each time you attack with the weapon, roll 1 action die. If you roll only 1 action, your ammunition depletes indicated by turning the ammunition card sideways. If your ammunition is already depleted, you have only one piece of ammunition left, represented by turning the card upside down. After using the last piece of ammunition, discard the ammunition card to the equipment deck discard pile. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-­handed weapon).

You may purchase more ammunition during a downtime or preparation round before deploying onto the world map by spending up to 3⛁. For each ⛁ spent, you roll one more action die when determining whether or not your ammunition depletes. Ammunition may use a maximum of three action dice.

Ammunition may be used to make melee attacks. If you are proficient with the weapon that uses the ammunition, you are proficient with melee attacks using that weapon's ammunition as well. Ammunition deals 1 point of damage. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

~~**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your STR or DEX for attack rolls.~~

> The finesse and versatile weapon properties are removed in 5eFP. There is now one attack roll that covers both melee and ranged attacks. At character creation, players choose whether their attack rolls are modified by DEX or STR.
>
> Some realism is sacrificed for ease of gameplay. Emphasizing one ability score for both attacks allows PCs to focus more closely on an ability score they wish to work with.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

**_Light._** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**_Multi-Use._** This weapon can be used multiple times, but each time it is used, there is a chance it will deplete, like ammunition. Each time you attack with a multi-use weapon, roll 1 action die. If you roll only 1 action, the multi-use weapon depletes indicated by turning the weapon card sideways. If your multi-use weapon is already depleted, you have only one left, represented by turning the card upside down. After using the last multi-use weapon, discard the weapon card to the equipment deck discard pile. Drawing the multi-use item from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.

You may purchase more multi-use items during a downtime or preparation round before deploying onto the world map by spending up to 3⛁. For each ⛁ spent on a chosen multi-use weapon, you roll one more action die when determining whether or not your multi-use weapon depletes. Ammunition may use a maximum of three action dice. Remove all depletion on all multi-use items, represented by returning the equipment card to its upright position, after spending ⛁ on Rest and Repairs.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists the weapon’s normal range in squares. You may make a ranged attack beyond the weapon's normal range, but doing so imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds +1 square to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon.

**_Two-­Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

~~**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A versatile weapon wielded in both hands deals an extra +1 damage. When a versatile weapon is transformed into a magic weapon, the magic property overrides the weapon's versatile property.~~

#### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

~~Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, characters proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and add their LEVEL to its attack bonus.~~

~~An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has range 4.~~

An improvised weapon deals 1 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object) with a range of 4 squares.

#### Silvered Weapons
Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest a little extra to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ammunition at a forge for 6⛁. You may spend trade goods silver (ore or bar) to reduce this cost to 3⛁. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

#### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**_Lance._** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 1 square of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

**_Net._** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 STR check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 1 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Acid._** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

**_Alchemist’s Fire._** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on ability checks against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 DEX check or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the DEX check.

Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).

Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX check or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make DEX check.

Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold
up to twenty crossbow bolts.

Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case
can hold up to ten rolled-­‐‑up sheets of paper or five rolled-­‐‑up sheets of parchment.

Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).

Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.

Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.

Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a WIS check.

Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-­‐‑B "Fantasy-­‐‑Historical Pantheons" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse.

Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.

A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-­‐‑level spell slot.

Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-­toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 DEX check or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 STR check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 3-square radius and dim light for an additional 6 squares. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-­‐‑foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius.

Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 CON check or take an additional 1 point of poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for the rest of the encounter before drying.

Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).

Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.

Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-­‐‑bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.

Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

# The 5eFP Framework

All 5eFP games follow the same rules framework. Elements of a 5eFP game include the following.

## Footholds

Footholds are points of interest within a world map tile wherein the forces opposing the PCs form an encounter. Unexplored world map tiles contain 5 randomly located footholds. In order to consider a world map explored, the PCs must first discover and resolve 3 footholds.

## Downtime

## Deploy

A group of PCs deploy to a designated world map tile simultaneously. Deployment starting location on an unexplored world map tile is randomized. During a round of downtime, PCs may deploy on their own to an explored location on the world map without determining a random starting location.

## Fast Travel

Once a destination is revealed and set on the world map, PCs may choose and deploy to it instantly without random encounters.

> For Game Masters: Why is deployment Randomized?
>> 
>> Come up with a reason that fits the story. For example, in Enchanted Forest, PCs use mystic skipping stones to fast travel to unexplored world map tiles. The stones are imprecise in where they land. This is a good reason why it is randomized. Others include getting lost, uncertainty, strong currents, resistance, or interference.
>>
> Variant Rules: Add Random Encounters
>>
>> GMs can add random encounters to a game by assigning up to five random encounters as footholds in an unexplored world map tile. When PCs encounter a foothold, they draw and resolve a creature encounter instead of drawing a story card until all random encounters are completed.

## Recall

When PCs in a group are finished with their objectives, they may recall back to the HQ map room at any time by performing a special ritual that can only be completed outside of an encounter. Once one or more PCs complete a recall ritual, all PCs in the group recall simultaneously, returning to the HQ map room. The nature of how PCs recall depends on the game world you are playing in, which is detailed in your setting handbook. PCs automatically recall if they haven't already done so after 8 hours.

~~Once deployed, PCs in a group may recall back to the headquarters (HQ) map room at any time by performing a special ritual that can only be completed outside of an encounter. Once one or more PCs complete a recall ritual, all PCs in the group recall simultaneously. After 8 hours have elapsed while deployed, any PC not currently located at HQ is automatically recalled. A PC may only recall once per game session.~~

> For Game Masters: How do the PCs recall?
> 
>> What technology does the game use to make this happen? Teleportation? Airlifting? Shuttles? Flying mounts?
>>
>> For example, in Enchanted Forest, the PCs use mystic skipping stone artifacts gifted to them when they graduate as a Queen's Herald. The stones are powerful magic items that cannot be destroyed. Each stone is unique and bonded to exactly one PC. PCs and their bonded stones simultaneously recall to HQ.
>>
> For Game Masters: Why do the PCs recall automatically after 8 hours?
> 
>> A condition or situation afflicts the world map. This condition or situation makes prolonged contact impossible or lethal. What's going on in your world map that explains this limit? For example, in Enchanted Forest, the Enchantress Queen can only keep the PCs safe from the Nightmare for up to 8 hours once the PCs have deployed. Keeping PCs safe from the Nightmare for 8 hours consumes 1 starflower. The Enchantress Queen must then finish a long rest before undertaking another deployment.

## Headquarters (HQ)

Headquarters (HQ) is a centralized organization to which all player characters (PCs) belong within a 5eFP campaign setting. HQ might be a city, a settlement, an outpost, a watch tower, a ship, or a station. All HQs have a dedicated society of supporters who help PCs complete HQ missions and guarantee safety and protection from whatever awaits beyond HQ's borders, provided PCs pay HQ's upkeep cost. See your setting handbook for more details on HQ upkeep costs. Most HQs are immobile and located at the center of the world map. PCs almost always begin and end a game at HQ.

HQs sometimes create satellite locations within the world map. Each satellite behaves as if it were HQ with different downtime options, and you may deploy to a satellite location at the start of your downtime round. Satellite locations are less secure than HQ but remain relatively safe and protected, provided PCs meet HQ's upkeep costs. Local circumstances, conditions, and disturbances can affect the safety and protection offered by HQ. A temporary suspension of HQ protection results in PCs losing the ability to rest and repair. Coins spent on rest and repairs are lost during these circumstances. 

HQ usually remains in one static location while PCs deploy on missions outward from the world map's center. However, some HQs relocate on the world map while other HQs have movable tokens representing a deployable vehicle or station with sufficient life support. Deployable HQ tokens function identically to static HQ world map tiles.

## World Map
- Map size: 14 squares by 14 squares
- Scale: 1 square equals 1 inch by 1 inch or about 2.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters
- Contains: (9) 2x2 world map tiles for each cardinal direction, (3) 2x2 world map tiles for each ordinal (hybrid) direction, and (1) 2x2 HQ tile

Draw clear boundaries around each world map tile (use a grid). Hybrid tiles: draw a dashed diagonal line from one corner of the world map tile to its opposite corner in a color that will stand out. This dashed line represents the road or highway. World map tiles containing a highway are considered hybrid. While exploring hybrid tiles, players draw and play story cards from adjacent story directions simultaneously.

The world map begins obscured. After choosing or creating the world map, place obscuring world map tiles over it. The nature of this obscurity is detailed in your setting handbook. The HQ (headquarters) tile is the only one not obscured at the beginning of the game. The HQ tile is placed at the map's center position. Obscuring world map tiles are removed whenever the PCs explore the world map tile it obscures. The following procedure must be completed to explore a world map tile:

- Explore 55% or more of the map.
- Find and resolve 3 footholds.
- Locate an item or perform an action according to the setting handbook.

Steps taken for world map deployment.
1. **Preview.** Druids and rangers receive a special bonus round. Each druid and ranger PC, in initiative order, may choose one unexplored world map tile within the current level of play and preview its terrain by temporarily removing its obscuring world map tile. Once finished, the player then returns the obscuring world map tile back to its original position.
2. **Selection.** The PCs, as a group, choose a cardinal or ordinal direction and trace a path from the HQ tile along the map until an obscured world map tile is encountered within the current level of play. This becomes the selected world map tile.
3. **Prepare.** Players may choose to spend 1 round of preparation before deploying. See "Preparation."
4. **Setup.** Place an empty (22 x 22) exploration map beside the world map. Roll a d20 onto the exploration map before placing any tiles and note the location of where the dice lands. This determines the starting position for the PCs.
5. **Deploy.** The GM reveals the starting map tile on the exploration map at the starting position determined in the previous step, placing the group token onto it.
6. **Choose Party Token Controller.** PCs appoint one player as the group token controller. This player can be the party leader, but this is not required. The PC with the most overland movement bonuses is typically the group token controller. Some background, species, and class features provide significant bonuses while controlling the group token during the exploration phase.
7. **Move the group token.** The group token controller moves the token, lifting any obscuring tiles encountered along the way. Removing an obscuring tile may reveal one of several potential world map features called footholds:
    - Dungeons
    - Creatures
    - Villages or settlements
    - Buildings
    - Treasures
    - Traps
    - Specific features or items necessary for completion as outlined in your setting handbook.

# Exploration Map

# Encounter Map

# Headquarters (HQ)

Headquarters (HQ) represents the core organization(s) that all player characters (PCs) belong to within a 5eFP campaign setting. HQ can be an organization, a settlement, an outpost, a watch tower, a ship, or a station. All HQs have a dedicated society of supporters who help PCs complete HQ missions and guarantee safety and protection from whatever awaits beyond HQ's borders, provided PCs pay HQ's upkeep cost. See your setting handbook for more details on HQ upkeep costs.

HQ usually remains in one static location while PCs deploy on missions outward from the world map's center. However, some HQs relocate on the world map while other HQs have movable tokens representing a deployable vehicle or station with sufficient life support. Deployable HQ tokens function identically to static HQ world map tiles.

Sometimes HQs create satellite locations within the world map. Treat satellite locations as extensions of HQ. PCs can spend their downtime in HQ or within one of HQ's satellite locations, which may provide alternative benefits. Satellite locations are less secure than HQ, but remain relatively safe and protected, provided PCs meet HQ's upkeep costs. Local circumstances, conditions, and disturbances can affect the safety and protection offered by HQ. A temporary suspension of HQ protection results in PCs losing the ability to rest and repair. Coins spent on rest and repairs are lost during these circumstances.

## Game Session Start

Unless stated otherwise, you always begin the game at HQ.

You begin the game by revealing the HQ world map tile to all players. Place the HQ tile at the world map center tile position, reading any read-aloud text listed in your setting handbook for the start of the game.

## Game Session End

Unless stated otherwise, you always end the game at HQ. The following occurs when PCs return to HQ:
1. All ongoing encounter powers, abilities, and features end.
2. PCs may pay 1 Coin for rest and repairs.
3. PCs take one downtime round (worker placement) by placing their token on a building within HQ (or linked through HQ at a satellite location).
4. PCs gain the benefits of completing a long rest.

# Between Adventures

After PCs recall, they each gain 1 round of downtime. PCs resolve their downtown rounds in initiative order. At the start of a PC's downtime round, they place their character token on an available space in HQ. At the end of the round, PCs gain any end-of-turn benefits associated with their chosen downtime location (see below).

## HQ

While at HQ, the following downtime options become available.

- Spend any amount of ⛁ on HQ upgrades.
- Spend any amount of ⛁ on HQ research.
- **Research.** Spend ⛁ and choose one from feature, item, location, or lore. Add the chosen research to the list of available HQ research. By default, research requires five coins to complete. When the research is complete, the PCs decide what is learned, revealing 1 new piece of information about the nature of the research. If it is determined that more than 1 piece of information can be gained through research, the PCs must begin and complete new research for each additional piece of information. Completing research on a feature upgrades gameplay, making the feature playable.

### Level 1 HQ Upgrades

- Buildings (10⛁)

### HQ Research

## Expanded Downtime Locations

The following locations offer expanded downtime options but must first be unlocked through upgrades or research. Unless stated otherwise, a building becomes unlocked when PCs complete the Buildings HQ upgrade.

### Docks

**Unlock.** Gain access to the docks by discovering the world map tile containing the docks symbol.

Downtime options:

- Spend any number of ⛁ on HQ's docks research upgrades.
- You and up to 4 additional PCs spend ⛁ to gain passage onboard a ship at HQ's docks. PCs on a ship resolve their downtime together once they board and move the ship.

### Market

### Temple

**Unlock.** In addition to the normal way of gaining access to the temple, unlock this location when one or more PCs choose the acolyte background.

The following downtime options are available at the temple.
- Spend (1) herbs to get (1) healing potion.
- Spend ⛁ to cast *lesser restoration*.
- Spend 5⛁ to cast *greater restoration*.
- Spend 25⛁ coins to cast *raise dead* on a fallen ally.

### Manor

### Barracks

### Forge

### Refugee Camps

### Firing Range

### Monument

### Tower

### Enclave

### Mystic Jeweler

### Library

### Guild

## Spending Coin
After the conclusion of a game session, players take 1 or more rounds of downtime. At the start of the downtime phase, PCs each roll a d20, adding the number of coins they currently have as a modifier. This number represents their downtime initiative. Each rolls a d20 and adds the number of Coins they currently have. This is called the downtime initiative, or just initiative.

## Downtime Activities
Whenever a PC chooses a specific downtime activity, it cannot be chosen again until the beginning of the next round of downtime. During a round of downtime, a PC can perform the following actions:

- **1 Action.** Choose and gain the benefit of 1 downtime activity.
- **1 Reaction.** You have one reaction during a round of downtime. Once you use your reaction, you cannot do so again until the beginning of the next round of downtime.
- **1 Bonus Action.** You may perform one bonus action during a round of downtime.
- **1 Object Interaction.** You may equip or unequip items.

### Crafting
Choose this option to create items used in the game.

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every round of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one item. The cost of creating some items requires spending more than one downtime round.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have the relevant tools equipped and are working together in the same place. Each additional character contributes +1 downtime round toward crafting the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities contribute +3 downtime rounds toward crafting a suit of plate armor. Crafting plate armor requires 6 rounds of downtime.
While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

Whenever you choose the crafting downtime activity, you can choose to create any 1 of the following items, provided you meet the prerequisites:

**Healing Potion.** You create a minor healing potion.
- (a) herbalism kit equiped and (b) 1 herbs trade good equipped, or (a) healer class

**Holy Water.** You create holy water.
- healer class or
- (a) acolyte bakground and (b) temple building

**Trade Goods.** You harvest, gather, or forge trade goods. Remove 1 trade good from your inventory: gain +1 round of downtime activity. Required:
- (a) guild artisan background and (b) artisan guildhall building, or
- (a) 1 trade good in your inventory and (b) the relevant tool is equipped

**.**

### Recuperating


### Researching


### Training

---

# Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a STR of +1 or higher. If your STR is reduced below +1 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your STR is restored.

## Armor Training (Heavy)

_Prerequisite: Proficiency with medium armor_

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and shields. At the beginning of each of your turns, if you are wearing heavy armor, you gain **bolster 1**. Unlike other sources of bolster, you may combine this bolster with another bolster. Once you combine bolsters in this way, you cannot do so again until your next turn.

- 3⛁: Permanently increase your bolster score granted through this feature by +1. You may choose this option up to three times and only once per level.

## Armor Training (Medium)

_Prerequisite: Proficiency with light armor_

You gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. Increase your maximum DEX score allowed while wearing medium armor by +1. Medium armor no longer imposes disadvantage on DEX checks.

## Armor Training (Light)

You gain proficiency with light armor and shields.

## Grappler

_Prerequisite: STR +1 or higher_

You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-­quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.

# Using Ability Scores

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength (STR)**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity (DEX)**, measuring agility
- **Constitution (CON)**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence (INT)**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom (WIS)**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma (CHA)**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-­bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.

The two main rolls of the game—the ability check and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of +0 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of +4 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as +5, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as +10.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus, which is equal to their LEVEL. Monsters may also have this bonus. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus is typically added to a single die roll or other number once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a WIS check, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the check.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be added one additional time (to a maximum of twice). For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature allows you to add your proficiency bonus twice for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than twice to the same roll, you still add it only twice.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to add an additional proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check, you do not have a proficiency bonus. Only ability checks you are proficient with gain an additional proficiency bonus. For instance, if you lack proficiency with CON, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you add an additional proficiency bonus when you make CON ability checks.

In general, you don’t add an additional proficiency bonus for attack rolls or ability checks. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

**Typical Difficult Classes**
|Task Difficulty|DC|
|:-|:-|
|Very easy|5|
|Easy|10|
|Medium|15|
|Hard|20|
|Very hard|25|
|Nearly impossible|30|

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

### Contests

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, Monrovia is a 1st-­level character with WIS +2. Thus Monrovia's passive WIS score is 13 (10 + 2 [WIS] + 1 [LEVEL]).

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.

### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group WIS check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game. (A character’s starting proficiencies are determined by class and background at character creation, and a monster’s ability proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)

### Strength (STR)

STR measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### STR Checks

A STR check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

The GM might call for a STR check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff
- Avoid hazards while scaling a wall
- Cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump
- Swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-­tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed
- Another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming
- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls

You add your STR to your attack roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-­hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your STR score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

_**Carrying Capacity.**_ Your carrying capacity is 3 + STR (minimum 1). This is how much equipment you can carry in addition to any equipped items.

_**Push, Drag, or Lift.**_ You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds equal to 30 x STR. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of this number, your speed drops to 1 square.

_**Size and Strength.**_ Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these values.

### Dexterity (DEX)

DEX measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### DEX Checks

A DEX check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.

The GM might call for a DEX check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Stay on your feet in a tricky situation
- Acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips
- Legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person
- Lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket
- Conceal yourself from others
- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
- Steer a chariot around a tight turn
- Pick a lock
- Disable a trap
- Securely tie up a prisoner
- Wriggle free of bonds
- Play a stringed instrument
- Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls

You add DEX to your attack roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add DEX to your attack roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

#### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of DEX to your Armor Class (AC).

#### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by rolling d20 + DEX. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.

> Hiding
>
> The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a DEX check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the WIS check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
> You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
>
> An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
>
> _**Passive WIS.**_ When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your DEX check with that creature’s passive WIS score, which equals 10 + the creature’s WIS score, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 proficiency, he or she has a passive WIS of 13.
>
> _**What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in "The Environment.”

### Constitution (CON)

CON measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### CON Checks

A CON check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### MAX Wounds

Your total MAX Wounds equals CON + MAX Wounds provided by your class.

If your CON modifier changes, calculate your new MAX Wounds total as though you had the new modifier. If your MAX Wounds reduces below the number of wounds you have, you fall unconscious and discard any excess wounds. Discarding any number of wounds in this way causes one automatic death save failure.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### INT Checks

An INT check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning.

The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes
- Recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations
- Recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles
- Recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults
- Look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues
- Communicate with a creature without using words
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Forge a document
- Recall lore about a craft or trade
- Win a game of skill

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wizards use INT as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom (WIS)

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### WIS Checks

A WIS check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person.

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions
- Determine the true intentions of a creature
- Stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness
- Spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something
- Follow tracks
- Hunt wild game
- Guide your group through frozen wastelands
- Identify signs that owlbears live nearby
- Predict the weather
- Avoid quicksand and other natural hazards
- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use WIS as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

### Charisma (CHA)

CHA measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### CHA Checks

A CHA check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation.

The GM might call for a CHA check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Convincingly hide the truth
- Influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence
- Delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment
- Influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature
- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
- Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use CHA as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the DCs of spells they cast.

## Resisting Spells and Game Features

Resisting a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat requires a successful ability check. You don’t normally decide to make these ability checks; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

The DC for a game feature is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the ability check DC for a spell is determined by the caster’s spell DC.

The result of a successful or failed ability check is also detailed in the effect that allows the ability check. Usually, a successful ability check means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

A character or monster can choose not to resist a spell or game feature.

## Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Magical darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

> 5eFP games obscure unexplored areas of a map with obscuring tiles. This fog-of-war effect is removed as PCs explore map tiles. Unless otherwise indicated, all revealed map tiles are lit by bright light. So, there is no dim light condition, and 5eFP games do not use darkvision rules nor cantrips whose sole purpose is to shed light, such as _light_ or _dancing lights_. This is a deliberate design feature to simplify combat on a grid.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as magical darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix [...]) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates two categories of illumination: bright light and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness in an area of magical darkness.

### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on ability checks against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Food and Water

Obtaining food and water is included when PCs spend coin on rest and repairs. Characters who do not spend coin on rest and repairs suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix [...]) during the next game session. Exhaustion caused by not resting and repairing can’t be removed until the character spends coin on rest and repairs.

> (This section needs to be moved to Rest and Repairs section.)

## Interacting with Objects

TBA

# Resting

TBA

## Rest (Short Rest)

A rest is a period of downtime, typically 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

PCs can discard a number of wounds equal to their level at the end of a short rest.

## Recall (Long Rest)

A recall occurs at the end of a game session once all adventure objectives have been completed or if the mission fails. Once you recall, you cannot do so again until the next game session. Immediately following a recall is a period of extended downtime.

If you spend coin on rest and repairs, this downtime includes an extended rest, typically at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activities. You discard any wounds you may have after completing this extended rest.

You may use 1 or more rounds of downtime after you recall. Additional rounds of downtime cost 1 coin each.

A character who recalls dead cannot gain any benefits from a recall until revived or healed.

A character who recalls stabilized at MAX Wounds may only spend a round of downtime to discard 1 wound, which revives the character. Once revived, the character can then spend additional coin on rest and repairs or unlock additional rounds of downtime by spending an extra coin for each.

Once a recall and all rounds of downtime are completed, you restore any class resources limited by a recall, including any expended spell slots, reset all recall effects and features, and the game session ends.

# Adventuring

TBA

## Time

5eFP simplifies time by adding a countdown clock with eight segments. At the start of the game session, the marker is set at the top or highest value. Starting an encounter, taking a rest, or using a special game rule or feature causes the countdown marker to decrease by 1 step (lower the number by - 1). When the countdown clock reaches 0, the PCs recall after the encounter or rest ends.

In combat and other fast-­paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-­second span of time.

## Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

### Fast Travel

Once a destination square is chosen on the world map and the deployment action is taken, PCs deploy instantaneously.

### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in squares that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move ~~in a minute, an hour, or a day~~.

#### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds are generally performed on relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-­filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-­covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 square in difficult terrain costs 2 squares of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance.

### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each square of movement costs 1 extra square (2 extra squares in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful STR check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful STR check.

#### Flying

While flying, you only trigger opportunity attacks from creatures with a reach score of 2 or more squares and fall prone when unconscious. Flight can be granted without also granting a fly speed, such as with the _fly_ spell or with certain game rules, features, or equipment. A fly speed grants the hover special ability. If you can hover, you do not fall prone when unconscious.

#### Jumping

Your STR determines how far you can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of squares up to STR if you move at least 2 squares on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs one square of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a STR check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a 1-square cube), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DEX check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of squares equal to STR if you move at least 2 squares on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs a square of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a STR check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms into adjacent squares up to your reach during the jump.


# Forming a Group

Unlike traditional tabletop roleplaying games, 5eFP has no set group or time to play. The game master (GM) posts available days and times for game sessions. Players then choose the best day and time for their schedule based on GM availability. The player who initiates forming a group becomes the group leader. A 5eFP group contains a minimum of three PCs and a maximum of five PCs.

All PCs in a group choose their group role before selecting a destination and deploying onto a map.

## Group Roles

When PCs form a group, they choose one of three beneficial status effects that activate while deployed on a map and last until the end of a game session. Group leaders may choose their group role first. A group can have a maximum of one defender, one healer, and up to three damage roles. The defender and healer roles are designated first, followed by damage roles.

### Defender

- **Act First.** At the start of an encounter and before any initiative is rolled, you take your turn first. After completing your turn, all initiatives are rolled as normal. Skip round 1, resuming normal gameplay afterward.
- **Taunt.** Your attacks, opposed or contested ability checks, spells, and features are difficult to ignore. If you attack, damage, or otherwise affect a minion, elite, or boss, they gain the taunted condition (see Conditions). Minions, elites, and bosses automatically gain the taunted condition at the beginning of their turn if you are the closest visible target. Minions, elites, and bosses lose the taunted condition whenever you are unconscious or incapacitated.
- **Soak.** At the beginning of a combat encounter, you gain Bolster 2.

### Healer

- The first time you target a creature with a spell, attack, ability check, or feature on each of your turns, resolve the spell, attack, or feature as normal. Afterward, you may choose a different creature within 1 square of your target. The chosen creature receives 1 point of healing and may make an additional ability check to end one ongoing negative condition.

### Damage

- The first time you target a creature with a spell, attack, ability check, or feature on each of your turns, resolve the spell, attack, or feature as normal. Afterward, you may choose a different creature within 1 square of your target. The chosen creature takes 1 point of damage. The damage type remains the same or bludgeoning (if no damage type is indicated).

## Group Token

While deployed on a map, one player becomes the group token controller. The group token represents the entire group and can move up to the controller's speed, one square at a time. After moving, the controller removes any fog of war tiles within 1 square of its current position. Removing a fog of war tile may trigger an encounter. Once the group token stops moving, PCs may choose to take a turn in initiative order. Players can take free actions and up to one action, bonus action, and reaction during a group token turn, but they cannot move the group token until the turn is completed.

Certain backgrounds, classes, and species have bonus features while controlling the group token. The PC with the highest movement or the best bonus features while moving the group token typically becomes the group token controller.

### World Map

While on the world map, if the group token triggers an encounter by moving onto a foothold, observe the direction in which the group token moved and leave the group token on the foothold. Set up an encounter map matching the group token's primary terrain. The players enter the map and place their tokens within one square of the side they entered the map in as close to marching order as possible before adding any creatures or map features onto the map. Once an encounter resolves, the players remove their tokens from the map, the GM puts away the encounter map, and gameplay resumes on the world map.

### Dungeon Encounter

While on a dungeon map, if the group token triggers an encounter, replace the group token with the player's tokens as close to marching order as possible before placing any creatures or map features onto the map. Once an encounter resolves, remove the player's tokens from the map and place the group token back onto the map on an accessible dungeon tile not obscured by a fog of war tile.

# Making An Attack

Whether you’re striking with a weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you deal damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

## Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is usually determined by encounter type (minion, elite, boss) and LEVEL, though your GM may modify AC values on some monsters.

### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability score and LEVEL. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses a modifier usually determined by encounter type (minion, elite, boss) and LEVEL. However, your GM may adjust modifiers on some monsters.

**Ability Score.** The ability score used for a weapon attack is usually STR or DEX. At character creation, you choose which ability to use. Monsters usually use the larger of the two ability scores for a weapon attack.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability score used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**LEVEL.** You add LEVEL to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.

### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes, circumstances can be favorable or unfavorable to a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the _invisibility_ spell, or lurking in magical darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 1 square of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand‑to‑hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 1‑square **reach** and can thus attack targets within 1 square of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 1 square, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head‑butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike is limited to dealing 1 point of bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Some classes, such as the monk, may deal extra damage with unarmed strikes.

#### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light weapon that you're holding in the other hand.

If either weapon can be used to make a ranged attack, you can throw it instead of making a melee attack.

#### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a STR check contested by the target’s STR or DEX check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-­A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Maintaining a Grapple.** You can maintain a grapple without taking an action, but doing so requires the continued use of your free hand.

**Escaping a Grapple.** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a STR or DEX check (the creature chooses the ability to use) contested by your STR check.

**Moving a Grappled Creature.** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

> ### Contests in Combat
>>
>> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.

#### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a STR check contested by the target’s STR or DEX check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 1 square away from you.

# Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three‑quarters cover, the target has three‑quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and DEX checks to resist attacks, spells, or game features directed at the target. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and DEX checks to resist attacks, spells, or game features directed at the target. A target has three‑quarters cover if about three‑quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

# Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well‑placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a _fireball_ spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

## Health

A creature's health represents a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and favorable circumstances. Creatures with a higher MAX Wounds score (see _Reaching MAX Wounds_ below) are more difficult to kill. Those with a lower MAX Wounds score are more fragile.

A creature’s health is determined by its number of wounds, which can be any number from 0 to a maximum number of wounds equal to its MAX Wounds score. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, it first checks whether or not any relevant game features reduce the damage. The remaining damage is dealt to a creature as an equal amount of wounds. Gaining wounds does not affect a creature’s capabilities until the number of wounds accumulated equals or exceeds their MAX Wounds score.

## Damage

Each **weapon**, **spell**, harmful monster ability, or game feature deals a minimum of 1 point of damage. Particularly damaging weapons, spells, harmful monster abilities, or game features may deal 2 or more damage. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, all of them receive the same amount of damage. For example, when a wizard casts _fireball_ or a cleric casts _flame strike_, the spell’s damage is dealt to all creatures caught in spell's area of effect.

### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to double the attack’s damage against the target. A critical hit does not double the damage of any secondary game features resolved after the attack.

For example, suppose you are playing a character with the damage party buff and attack with a dagger, which deals 1 point of slashing damage on a successful attack. If you score a critical hit with the dagger, it deals 2 points of damage, rather than 1. Since you have the damage party buff, after resolving the attack, you then deal 1 point of damage to a creature within 1 square of the original target. The extra damage isn't doubled. If the attack involves additional damage, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you double this damage as well.

### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**Acid.** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**Bludgeoning.** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**Cold.** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**Fire.** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**Force.** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including _magic missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.

**Lightning.** A _lightning bolt_ spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.

**Piercing.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s _flame strike_ spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _thunderwave_ spell, deals thunder damage.

Attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects sometimes simultaneously deal multiple types of damage. When this happens, the damage type that is least resisted by the target is assigned.

## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 3 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 1. The 3 damage is first reduced by 1 and then halved, so the creature takes 1 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three‐quarters.

## Healing

All healing effects provide a minimum of 1 point of healing. Particularly strong healing may provide 2 or more points of healing. For each point of healing, you discard 1 wound. When you receive healing, you also stabilize. You stabilize from healing even if the amount of healing is reduced to 0.

Unless it results in death, wounds aren't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can discard a creature's wounds, and magical methods such as a _cure wounds_ spell or a potion of healing can discard wounds in an instant.

A creature can never have less than 0 wounds, so any additional wounds discarded are ignored. For example, a druid grants a ranger 2 points of healing, allowing the ranger to discard 2 wounds. If the ranger only has 1 wound, the ranger discards 1 wound, not 2.

A creature that has died can’t discard wounds until magic such as the _revivify spell_ has restored it to life.

## Reaching MAX Wounds

When you gain enough wounds to equal or exceed your MAX Wounds score, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage assigns enough wounds to exceed your MAX Wounds score, you die if the number of exceeding wounds is equal to or greater than your MAX Wounds score.

For example, a cleric with MAX Wounds 6 currently has 3 wounds. If she takes 9 damage from an attack, she gains enough wounds to reach MAX Wounds, but 6 additional wounds remain. Because the remaining wounds equal her MAX Wounds score, the cleric dies.

### Falling Unconscious

If damage assigns enough wounds to equal or exceed your MAX Wounds score and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-­A). This unconsciousness ends if you receive healing.

### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with MAX Wounds, you must spend your turn making a special d20 roll, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other die rolls, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on death saves.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you receive healing or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you receive 1 point of healing.

**Taking damage while at MAX Wounds.** If you take any damage while you have MAX Wounds, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage assigns enough damage to meet or exceed your MAX Wounds score, you suffer instant death.

### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a dying creature at MAX Wounds is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 WIS check.

A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it might still be at MAX Wounds, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed receives 1 point of healing at the end of the encounter and discards the unconscious condition.

### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it reaches MAX Wounds, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters (NPCs) are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

## Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker adds enough wounds to a creature to reach its MAX Wounds score with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and becomes stabilized.

# Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

## Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 1 square of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 6 squares, you must spend 3 squares of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 3 squares of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX check or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 1 square of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same check.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 1 square of it.

## Controlling a Mount

While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

# Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

# Spellcasting

Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.

This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

> Some gaming worlds, such as those in science fantasy, futuristic, or modern settings, may refer to "magic" as preternatural or technological rather than "magical."
>
> You can use these same spellcasting rules, replacing terms and common usage. For example, preternatural effects may require the use of an implement such as an 8-inch to 1-foot-long thin piece of synthetic, wood, metal, or composite material infused with energy instead of a free hand, which effectively still requires a free hand to grasp the implement.
>
> You can replace or "reskin" how magic works in your game, but you must still keep these spellcasting rules and limitations. 

## What Is a Spell?

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-­A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and understanding to do so.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 7. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) _magic missile_ at 1st level and the earth-­shaking _earthquake_ at 7th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level correspond directly. To cast a spell, your level must equal or exceed the spell's level. For example, a character must be at least 2nd-level to cast a 2nd-­level spell, and the most powerful spells, 7th-level, become available during character level 7.

Spellcasters gain access to paragon spells at level 5 and epic spells at level 6 through the paragon spell and epic spell upgrades, respectively. These spells are potent magical effects that can only be cast once per game session.

### Known and Prepared Spells

Spellcasters must have the spell firmly fixed in mind before they can use it, or they must have access to the spell with a magic item. Spellcasters ~~Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers,~~ have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-­using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

> Choosing prepared spells can be time-consuming. To expedite gameplay, 5eFP spellcasters who prepare a spell list (clerics, druids, wizards) may prepare up to three different lists of prepared spells. It can help to have a damage, healing, and defender or support list. They then choose which spell list to use for the game session before deploying from HQ. If you have a class feature that allows you to swap prepared spells, you swap spells from one list to another until the end of the game session.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on how many Magic feature upgrades a character unlocks with ⛁.

### Spell Slots

Regardless of how many spells casters know or prepare, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so.

When characters cast a spell, they expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-­level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-­level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 7th-level spell fits only in a 7th-­level slot.

Spell slots are restored at the end of a game session.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a spellcaster casts _magic missile_ using a 2nd-­level slot, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

>#### Casting in Armor
>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell can only be cast outside of a combat encounter and generally takes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.

## Casting a Spell

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

#### Reactions

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, bonus action, or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

**Downtime Rounds.** Some spells can only be cast when completing a downtime round. These spells may take hours or even a day to cast. If the location where you are spending a downtime round loses HQ protection, you lose concentration and must use another downtime round at a location with HQ protection to cast it again.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like _magic missile_, the target is a creature. For a spell like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in squares. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the _shield_ spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V) or somatic (S) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)

Some spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

~~#### Material (M)~~

~~Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.~~

~~If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.~~

~~A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.~~

### Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be the length of an encounter, instantaneous, or until the PCs recall back to HQ. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Encounter

A number of spells have durations longer than an instant but shorter than a game session. These spells persist for the length of an encounter. Whenever you cast these spells while on the overland map, their effects remain as long as you do not change maps. If you change maps due to an encounter or by entering a foothold, the spell's duration ends when the encounter or foothold completes either in success or failure.

#### Instantaneous

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Recall

Some spells have lingering effects. A spell with a duration of recall lasts until the players return to HQ.

> A recall is a special ritual any PC can complete that can only be performed outside of an encounter. Once one or more PCs complete the recall ritual, all players return to the map room at HQ. PCs automatically recall after 8 hours have elapsed since deploying.

### Concentration

Spells with durations longer than instantaneous require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
- **Casting another spell with a duration longer than instantaneous.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

~~The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-­tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 CON check to maintain concentration on a spell.~~

### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect

Spells such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

#### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Resisting Spells

Many spells specify that a target can make an ability check to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the check and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 10 + your spellcasting ability + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 1 square of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.

>#### The Schools of Magic
>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
>
>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
>
>**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
>
>**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
>
>**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
>
>**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
>**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
>
>**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
>
>**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
>
>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.
>
>**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

|**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach)|
|**Duration:** Instantaneous|

|A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1 acid damage immediately and 1 acid damage at the end of its next turn.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by +1 for each slot level above 2nd.|

#### Acid Splash
|_Conjuration cantrip_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 12|
|**Components:** V, S|
|**Duration:** Instantaneous|
||
|You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 1 square of each other. A target must succeed on a DEX check or take 1 acid damage.|

#### Aid
|_2nd-level abjuration_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)|
|**Duration:** Recall|

#### Alarm
|_1st-­level abjuration (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 minute|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.|
|A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.|
|An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 12 feet.|

#### Alter Self
|_2nd-­level transmutation_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V, S|
|**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour|
||
|You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.|
|**Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.|
|**Change Appearance.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.|
|**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice.
Your unarmed strikes deal 1 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.|

#### Animal Friendship
|_1st-­level enchantment_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a WIS check or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.|

#### Animal Messenger
|_2nd-­level enchantment (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-­haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-­five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering 2 world map tiles for a flying messenger, or 1 world map tile for other animals. When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.|
|**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the distance the animal messenger travels increases by +1 world map tile for each slot level above 2nd.|

#### Arcane Lock
|_2nd-level abjuration_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)|
|**Duration:** Until dispelled|
||
|You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 1 square of the object, suppresses this spell long enough to allow passage. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for the rest of the encounter.|
|While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.|

#### Arcanist’s Magic Aura
|_2nd-­level illusion_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)|
|**Duration:** Recall|
||
|You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.|
|When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.|
|**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.|
|**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.|

#### Augury
|_2nd-­level divination (ritual)_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V, S, M (talisman)|
|**Duration:** Instantaneous|
||
|By casting gem-­inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take before recalling back to HQ. The GM rolls an action die (d6) and compares the number of bolt symbols to the following possible omens:|
||
- 1 (1 bolt): Weal, for good results
- 6 (2 bolts): Woe, for bad results
- 2-5 (blank): Mixed or unclear results

|  |
|:-|
|The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.|
|The GM makes any necessary adjustments to the narrative to incorporate these readings into the story.|

|**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|

|_1st-­level enchantment_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|
||
|You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or an ability check before the spell ends, the target makes these rolls with advantage. This spell removes the effects of *bane.*|
|**At Higher Levels.** At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.|

#### Blindness/Deafness
|_2nd-­level necromancy_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** 6|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Encounter|
||
|You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a CON check. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a CON check. On a success, the spell ends.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.|

#### Blur
|_2nd-­level illusion_|

|**Casting Time:** 1 action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|
||
|Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.|

#### Branding Smite
|_2nd-­level evocation_|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action|
|**Range:** Self|
|**Components:** V|
|**Duration:** Concentration (encounter)|
||
|The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 1 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 1 square radius and can't become invisible until the spell ends.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by +1 for each slot level above 2nd|

#### Burning Hands

Calm Emotions
2nd-­level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 12
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 4-square radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a CHA check. If a creature fails its check, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

|You summon a fey spirit that takes the form of a beast and appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. Choose one beast of challenge rating 2 or lower. The beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.|
|The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, the animal defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.|

|7th-level illusion|
|:-|
|**Casting Time:** 1 downtime round|
|**Range:** Touch|
|**Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to make a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature's body placed inside the snow or ice)|
|**Duration:** Until dispelled|
||
|You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but its MAX Wounds is half the creature’s MAX Wounds and it is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.|
|The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots. Simulacrums cannot cast _simulacrum_ or _wish_.|
|Once you cast _simulacrum_, you cannot cast it again until you gain a level of experience.|
|If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, spending 1 or more coins to heal an equal number of wounds. The simulacrum lasts until it reaches MAX Wounds, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.|
|If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.|

|A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 3-square cube originating from you must make a CON check. On a failed check, a creature takes 1 thunder damage and is pushed 2 squares away from you. On a successful check, the creature takes half damage and isn’t pushed.|
|In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 2 squares away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible on the entire map.|
|**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by +1 for each slot level above 1st.|

# Encounters

5eFP uses encounters to describe the adversity PCs find while exploring maps. Traps, unfavorable environmental conditions, creatures, and challenging story situations are all considered encounters. Use the following table to determine the base statistics for all encounters. Except for forced movement, minion damage, and minion MAX wounds, add LEVEL to the base values.

|   |**Minion**|**Elite**|**Boss**|
|--:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
|**Armor Class (AC)**|12|13|14|
|**Difficulty Class (DC)**|12|13|14|
|**Bonus**|+2|+3|+4|
|**Damage**|1|1|1|
|**MAX Wounds**|1|2|4|
|**Forced Movement**|1|1 or 2|2|

**Minion.** Minions represent simple encounters. Monster encounters treat minions as creatures with minimal stats that can only sustain one point of damage with MAX wounds of 1. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must meet a single challenge to overcome the encounter. Examples: a trap that does not reset or picking a lock. While minion monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster encounters may take minutes to resolve.

Some creature minions have the critter tag. Critters are typically tiny or small creatures. They deal 0 damage, have a +1 bonus and a DC of 10. Critters can be upgraded. An upgraded critter shares the same base statistics as minions, but they do not add LEVEL to their base values.

**Elite.** Elites represent advanced encounters which may include a number of minion encounters. Monster encounters treat elites as creatures with advanced stats and features. Non-monster encounters represent situations where PCs must overcome adversity several times before achieving completion. Examples: convince a skeptical creature of something or gather clues. While elite monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster elite encounters may take an hour to resolve.

**Boss.** Boss encounters are difficult and include minion encounters. Monster encounters treat bosses as creatures with advanced stats, features, and special tactics benefiting from the presence of one or more minions. Non-monster encounters represent difficult situations where PCs must overcome challenging conditions several times while also dealing with some simultaneous minion encounters. Non-monster boss encounters resolve after all non-monster minion encounters are resolved. Examples: attempt to sway the opinion of an adversary and associated followers or put out a fire spreading through a village while rescuing trapped villagers. While boss monster encounters are resolved in rounds, non-monster boss encounters may take several hours to resolve.

**LEVEL.** The current level of play.

**Armor Class (AC).** If the PCs take action against an encounter resulting in a melee or ranged attack, they must hit an AC equal to this number to succeed.

**Difficulty Class (DC).** If an encounter requires an ability check, set the DC to this number.

**Bonus.** If any part of an encounter relies on a modifier to a d20 roll, it uses this number as the modifier. An encounter may list one or more ability scores with bonuses in its description. If the encounter rolls an ability check with one of the listed ability scores, add its corresponding bonus to the result.

If an encounter relies on a passive bonus, determine the passive bonus by adding 10 to the value of this bonus.

**Damage.** If any part of the encounter deals damage, it deals a number of points of damage equal to this number.

**MAX Wounds.** If any part of the encounter can sustain points of damage, it gains MAX wounds equal to this number. Any PC action taken to end an encounter is considered damage. Thus, a diplomatic crisis may have a MAX wounds stat representing how many times the PCs must affect the encounter before it resolves.

**Forced Movement.** If any part of the encounter imposes forced movement, this number represents the number of squares of forced movement. If no direction is stated, the movement is a push.

## Customizing Encounters

The encounter statistics provided represent average values. Any number of statistics may be increased by up to +(LEVEL), provided the same amount decreases another statistic. Only stats used in an encounter can be customized. For example, during a level 1 monster encounter, the GM increases an awakened shrub minion's AC by +1. The cost of increasing the minion's AC is paid by the GM choosing to decrease the awakened shrub minion's attack modifier by -1. In this example, the GM couldn't decrease the DC stat by -1 because the awakened shrub minion doesn't possess a stat using a DC. However, if the encounter includes a condition or effect requiring an ability check to resist, the DC stat can be decreased by -1.

A minion's MAX wounds and damage cannot be customized.

Encounter elements cannot be reduced below the following values:
- **AC** 12 (minion), 13 (elite), 14 (boss)
- **Damage** 1
- **DC** 12 (minion), 13 (elite), 14 (boss)
- **Speed** 2
- **MAX Wounds (elite)** 2
- **MAX Wounds (boss)** 5 

# Encounter Type

Encounter type describes the kind of encounter you discover.

## Treasure

A treasure encounter may include

> MINION TREASURE
>
>> Treasure of type minion awards ⛁ once discovered. A treasure might be hidden, in plain sight, trapped, or untrapped.
>>
> ELITE TREASURE
>
>> Treasure of type elite rewards ⛁ once discovered. Elite treasures are often protected by an elite trap or one minion creature encounter.
>>
> BOSS TREASURE
>
>> Boss treasures award the greatest amount of coin, but are the most difficult to finish. These encounters are awarded ⛁ upon discovery but potentially contain more bonus coins. It is difficult, if not impossible, to unlock all boss treasure bonus coins. Boss treasure encounters require (MAX Wounds) successful WIS checks to find ⛁, and may include a boss trap or a boss creature encounter before resolving.

## Monster

Monster encounters use the encounter stats provided to determine the monster's strengths and statistics.

>Monster encounters use one of three templates:
>
>- **Minion.** Place (number of PCs + 1) minions onto the playing field.
>- **Elite.** As **Minion** plus add 2 elites onto the playing field.
>- **Boss.** As **Minion** plus add 1 boss onto the playing field adjacent to a minion.

### Size

### Type

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also to other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals or the Primordials. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The genie species, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid species are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

#### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment

A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-­‐‑aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.

### Size

- If an elite monster's size is less than medium, its size becomes medium.

- If a boss monster's size is less than large, its size becomes large. 

If a monster minion is small, the elite version's size increases to medium. If an elite monster's size is medium, the boss version's size increases to large.

### Speed

A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn measured in squares.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-­based locomotion have a walking speed of 0.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

#### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.

#### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

#### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Abilities

The Abilities entry is reserved for monsters proficient in one or more abilities. For example, a very perceptive and stealthy monster might have bonuses to WIS and CHA checks. If a monster lists abilities, add LEVEL to related ability checks they make.

Passive abilities also benefit from listed abilities. Increase a passive score with a listed ability by + LEVEL.

Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-­than-­expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster’s senses. Senses are described below.

#### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

>#### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies
>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.

#### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

#### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on ability checks against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.

### Challenge

When determining the challenge of a monster encounter, let *N* equal the number of PCs + 1.

An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of adventurers should be able to defeat *N* minions, *N* minions and two elites, or *N* minions and one boss without suffering any deaths.

### Special Traits

Special traits (which appear before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting

A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a mage might be able to innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the mage.

A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells.

#### Spellcasting

A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.

A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-­level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-­level spell by using one of its 5th-­level spell slots.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its description.

#### Psionics

A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see (TBD).

**Creature vs. Target.** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

**Hit.** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation.

**Miss.** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. Defeated monsters using ammunition drop (basic ammunition).

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**Bolster X.** The notation "Bolster X" means a monster can use a special pool of points to reduce incoming damage. As long as this creature has a bolster pool of 1 or more, it may assign 1 or more bolster points as a free action and reduce incoming damage by 1 for each point spent. Spent points are lost. Whenever a creature has two or more bolster pools, it keeps the largest bolster pool and discards the rest.

For example, "Bolster 2" means a monster can use up to 2 bolster points as a free action to reduce incoming damage by an amount equal to the number of bolster points spent. If the creature uses 1 bolster point, it then has "Bolster 1." If it later gains "Bolster 2," the creature gains "Bolster 2" and discards "Bolster 1."

**X/Game.** The notation “X/Game” means a special ability or feature can only be used X number of times during one game session.

**Recharge X–Y.** The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll three action dice. If the number of actions equals one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short rest.

For example, “Recharge 3–4” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls 3 or 4 actions after rolling three action dice.

**Recharge after a Short Rest.** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short rest to use it again.

>#### Grapple Rules for Monsters
>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.
>
>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a contested STR check.

### Equipment

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.

### Bosses are Legendary Creatures

Bosses are legendary creatures because they can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. They can take special actions outside their turn, and they might exert magical or mundane influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a boss, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

### Legendary Actions

A boss can take up to three special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Default Legendary Actions

All bosses automatically have the following legendary actions.

- **Attack (1 Action).** The boss makes one attack against a creature within range.
- **Bolster (2 Actions).** The boss gains **bolster (LEVEL)**. A boss can only activate this legendary action if a minion is within its line of sight.

### A Boss' Lair

A boss might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a boss that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a boss can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the boss is defeated.

### Monster Descriptions

All monster descriptions are detailed in Appendix MM.

## Dungeon

Dungeon encounters use the encounter stats provided to determine the strength of any monsters, traps, and other adversity found on one floor of a contained, multi-room structure. Details such as light levels, room height, wall and floor composition, and type of doors in the dungeon are described first.

If a dungeon contains a passage leading to a higher or lower floor, the new floor would be a LEVEL+3 area. Floor changes are cumulative if they advance in the same direction. If a set of stairs in a level 1 dungeon leads down two floors, the new floor would be a LEVEL+6 (level 7) area. While searching the level 7 area, the PCs find a rope leading up through a hole in the floor. They climb the rope and find themselves in a level 4 area. Then, if the PCs find a staircase leading up, the next floor would return to a level 1 area.

Dungeons may have one or more bonus features.

### Bonus Feature: Danger Room

Danger rooms are always obscured by a reinforced and locked door or an opaque phenomenon keeping creatures out that is clearly labeled as deadly. PCs must first acknowledge the warnings to enter a danger room. Acknowledgment unlocks the door or phenomenon, allowing passage. If the PCs advance into a danger room, they must face a boss battle at difficulty (LEVEL + 2). The way out vanishes the moment the PCs reach the danger room and does not reappear until the end of the encounter. The monster encounter is set up as if there are five PCs (even if the party is less than five) and two bonus elites are added to the encounter. If the PCs overcome the encounter, an unlocked, trap-free ornate chest appears. Each PC may, in turn, approach the chest and open it. The PC then chooses and adds one treasure to their equipment from three discovered treasures, discarding the other two choices. PCs choose one treasure from three available treasures: class, advanced, or magic item. Roll/draw the treasures and pick one to keep.

> ### Danger Room Treasures
> 
>> Danger rooms are unique game zones that contain a very powerful boss (super boss) creature encounter, requiring optimization with the best gear, features, party buffs, and abilities you can muster into a five-player party. You discover treasure from three potential treasure types once you clear a danger room.
>>
>> **Class.** Treasure your class considers essential. For example, barbarians might discover handaxes, javelins, a battle axe, a shield, light armor, or medium armor
>>
>> **Advanced.** Rare items your class considers valuable. For example, barbarians might discover a healing potion, a martial weapon, trade goods, or ⛁
>>
>> **Magic Item.** The best items in the game for your class. For example, barbarians might discover magic armor, weapons, shields, rings, necklaces, vestments

## Trap

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-­filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as _glyph of warding_ and _symbol_ that function as traps.

#### Traps in Play

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it. These choices are randomly determined when a trap is discovered.

**Triggering a Trap.** Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the _glyph of warding_ spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.

**Detecting and Disabling a Trap.** Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.

A trap uses the encounter stats provided to determine the checks needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a WIS check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive WIS score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an INT check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a DEX check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.

Any character with the spellcasting feature can attempt a WIS check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. In addition, _dispel magic_ also has a chance of disabling most magic traps.

In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.

**Trap Effects.** The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.

> MINION TRAPS
>
>> Traps of type minion do not reset after triggering.
>>
> ELITE TRAPS
>
>> Traps of type elite require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to disable and may trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing.
>>
> BOSS TRAPS
>
>> The deadliest traps are boss traps. These hazards are difficult, if not impossible, to bypass or avoid, require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to disable, and may trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing. Also, boss traps have several smaller components that trigger independently. PCs must deal with or remove all of these smaller components, or the boss trap resets.

## Settlement

A settlement uses the encounter stats provided to determine the checks needed to find it, resolve the encounter, or both.

> MINION SETTLEMENT
>
>> Minion settlements are small communities without a council or leader, consisting of hamlets or loose collections of homes or shelters.
>>
> ELITE SETTLEMENT
>
>> Settlements of type elite are villages with (MAX Wounds) council members, typically a mayor or leader, and a militia. An elite settlement encounter requires (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to resolve the encounter before finishing.
>>
> BOSS SETTLEMENT
>
>> The largest communities are boss settlements. These are towns or city-castles with (MAX Wounds) council members, a mayor or leader (some have multiple leaders), a militia, city guard, and barracks that are difficult, if not impossible, to bypass or avoid, require (MAX Wounds) successful attempts to resolve the encounter which may have secondary events that trigger up to (MAX Wounds) times before finishing. Also, boss settlements have several smaller communities that trigger independent minion encounters. PCs must deal with or remove all of these triggered minion encounters or the boss settlement encounter resets.
>>
>> While a boss settlement encounter is unresolved, it gains bolster (LEVEL) after all PCs have finished taking their turn.

## Campfire (Short Rest)

A campfire encounter usually doesn't need encounter stats to resolve, but you can use the provided stats if necessary.

Campfire encounters are initiated during a short rest and resolve at the end of the short rest. Campfire encounters should take up at most 10 minutes of game-session time. When a campfire scene resolves, the party token controller reveals obscuring map tiles up to 3 squares away from the party token.

Campfire encounters do not require the presence of a campfire to be considered campfire encounters.

~~During a campfire encounter, players are encouraged to interact and roleplay with one another. One PC takes the focus as far as setting the scene and driving the scene. The other PCs work themselves into the scene in some way. It doesn't need to be elaborate. PCs can have focused and directed conversations with the group this way. After describing the initial scene, the focus is released. They may choose to use the campfire encounter to plan their next course of action, speak with the locals, gather and analyze clues, perform a complicated ritual, share a meal together, play games, etc.~~

During a campfire encounter, one PC volunteers to set the scene and drives the initial interaction while the others join in and play with the focus created in the story. Typically, the volunteer desires to initiate a specific kind of roleplaying scenario. PCs can have conversations, plan their next move, talk to locals, gather clues, share a meal, play games, and more.

When you discover a campfire encounter, you can use it immediately or wait and use it later. You can only use it immediately if your party is not already in an encounter or the party token is not next to an unresolved foothold or setting requirement. If you use the campfire encounter immediately, your party gets the benefits of a short rest without it counting toward the total number of short rests available in the game session.

Discard any unused campfires on recall.

# Appendix PH-A: Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded

- A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Charmed

- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

## Deafened

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.
>
> |Level|Effect|
> |:-:|:-|
> |1|Disadvantage on ability checks|
> |2|Speed halved|
> |3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks|
> |4|Hit point maximum halved|
> |5|Speed reduced to 0|
> |6+|Death|

## Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

## Grappled

- A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the _thunderwave_ spell.

## Incapacitated

## Invisible

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

## Prone

- A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

## Restrained

- A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on DEX checks.

# Sample Setting Handbook

## Enchanted Forest

The Enchanted Forest's beloved Enchantress Queen (Queen) falls gravely ill as waves of weary and injured refugees enter through all four charmed gates of Castle Somnam (HQ), bringing harrowed tales of encroaching darkness. The Nightmare, a darkly magical reality overlaying the world and the realm known as the Plane of Shadow (Shadowfell), breached the Enchanted Forest's borders, spreading its long shadows across the land and transforming all it touched into strange and twisted reflections. The realm is no longer as it once was. Castle Somnam remains the only location unaffected by the Nightmare, thanks to the monarch's mystical protections imbued within the city castle's walls. An elite assembly of champions, known as the Queen's Heralds (Heralds), are charged with keeping the realm and its people healthy, thriving, and safe from harm.

You joined the Queen's Heralds and now, just before your graduation, you are called to participate in one important, final test: you must travel to the Crypt of the Continual Flame on foot deep into the Megalithic Highlands. You and your friends must make the journey alone unaided by your fellow students, peers, and instructors. You must make your way to the Crypt using a simple map. There, you will light your torch within the Hall of the Continual Flame and return it as proof of completion. Only then do you officially become a Herald.
